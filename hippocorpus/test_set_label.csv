I went to the hospital to get a diagnosis with my friend Belle. Once I arrived the secretary told me I had to wait 2-3 hours to be seen. Approximately 5 hours later I was seen by a doctor and he suggested we do an extended EEG to analyze brain wave activity and see if there was anything abnormal. The process took no more than 15 minutes and then the doctor told me that he did indeed see some abnormal activity but he could not discern the cause of my symptoms and would refer me to a specialist for a second opinion. I was very stressed out but so happy that my friend Belle was there to support me and even though my head still ached from time to time I was able to finally sleep that night.

Everyone screamed when it happened. Luckily for us, we were at least a half a mile or so back, so our vehicle wasn't involved in the accident, but a mid-sized sedan was completely crushed on impact. We were all shaking at what we just witnessed. Everyone, including the floor manager was in complete shock. We couldn't decide if we should stay put, or get out and try to help, but for certain, we all called for help on our phones. We were trapped behind  the wreckage, as there was no exit on this stretch of highway, and we certainly couldn't go backwards. So we stayed put and watched as everything unfolded in front of us. We couldn't hear what was going on, but we saw the people who were closer to the carnage, get out and try as much as they could to help. The Fed-Ex driver was dragged from his vehicle, and we say many people try to lift the carriage of the crashed truck off of the mid-sided sedan. The semi-trailer driver emerged from his vehicle, very shaken but otherwise seemingly unharmed.  The contents of the Fed-Ex truck were all over the highway, littering the stretch of road with tons of boxes.  Everyone was afraid for the people in the mid-sided sedan, and praying that, whoever they were, they were ok.

I trained 6 days a week for a year, getting up early and being constantly sore. I ate right and did all I could to get myself ready. The day of the race I was in the best shape of my life.

Apparently the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes and lungs and was continuing to grow fast. I won't focus on the details here, but the plan was about two weeks of radiation as soon as possible and chemotherapy from there. The overall outlook looks very poor. Like I said, this was not information thrown at us all at once right then and there. The picture was revealed throughout the week via correspondence and examiner's reactions.

My mother took care of myself and small child so my husband could still work, we wouldn't have been able to make it through without her and I'm eternally grateful.

However, after several drinks we started proposing dares for us to do, and mine was one that started a chain of even I still remember today. One of my friends, let's call him Jim, dared for me to walk up to one of the women at the bar and ask her number. My friends knew I was single and that I was shy, so they knew I would be a nervous wreck going up to a woman and just start chatting with her.

In fact, she said she found my nervousness with her rather cute. If I'd gone up to her all macho, she said she would have shut me down harshly in front of everyone. That I was 'real' with her and not trying to fake a persona was something she respected.

I was kicked out of that college at the end of the Fall 2018 semester, and had been missing them for a good few months. At first all went well, and we hit it off with some ordered pizza and video games. Things got strange mid-way through, however, and the student that I was visiting started acting strange.

After I got home from the ordeal I laid down for a bit, and thought about the situation thoroughly, trying to find something to make sense of it all. For that entire day I ghosted the student, not answering any of his messages or making any attempt to reach out to him over the situation. I felt filthy, and to say that I was depressed for that period was an understatement. When I finally did gather up the courage to tell him how I felt, I had to force the confrontation out of myself.  He apologized, and said that he wouldn't do it again. He said that he agreed he felt his actions were wrong, and in the heat of the moment. However, that was not the end of his behavior in that way, and I spent more months talking to him and subjecting myself to his treatment.

While in the staging lanes, my family was all around the car and we were just saying how fun it was to be at the track and that there was no pressure. It was time for the race rounds to begin so I got into the car, buckled in, and put my helmet on. I waited for my chance to run and got the car pre-staged. The lights came down and I had a really sharp reaction time. The other racer had a great reaction as well. When we got to the finish line, he was slightly ahead and I lost the race.

She's just a little more forgetful than she used to be, which is dangerous when she needs to be on top of taking medication.

Diane was not exaggerating. The day started off on a cruise through the Alaskan waters.   On the cruise was the most fantastic sushi which made me feel regret that it was contained only on the ship.   Afterwards, noticing the pool empty in this cold climate, we took a swim, with a delightful contrast of the cold of the air compared to the warmth of the heated pool.

At around 6 o'clock in the evening, I suffered a massive panic attack and fell into a state of intense emotional crisis. I've been battling with EXTREME anxiety and depression for near a decade now. This disorder developed as a result of a traumatic experience with a very high dose of psychedelic mushrooms in late 2010. In order to cope, I eventually turned to the realm of spirituality. Practices like meditation, yoga, and self-inquiry helped me to better manage the immensely dark feelings that I would encounter on a daily basis. But my relationship with spirituality changed overnight on the 1st of may this year. The panic attack centered heavily around my spiritual practices and this gave the crisis that followed an existential theme. Other themes were present as well such as identity and metaphysics, but they all fit neatly under the umbrella of spirituality and an inquisitive mind. I've since sought out medication and counseling which has allowed me to slowly regain a sense of normalcy. Giving a description of how emotionally scarring a true existential crisis can be is virtually impossible as no words can do it justice. It shook me to the core and persisted for weeks and still persists to some extent to this day. I was practically bedridden and totally paralyzed with fear and anxiety for hours at a time, day after day. As gloomy as this sounds though, I firmly believe that good can absolutely still come of it. If handled properly it can lead to a dramatically improved mode of being.",2.0,The mental illness I've struggled with for many years now was kicked up a notch a few months ago.

We'd spent a lovely week at the beach and although we regretted having to leave, home was a welcome destination. Since we were traveling by interstate there wasn't much to see. We expected to miss most of the Atlanta traffic since it was a Sunday morning but as we got into downtown, all the lanes on I-75 were closed down except for one. The line of cars stretched well out of site and we were lucky to move at all. My dad was trying to move over to the lane that the traffic was showing a bit of movement but he wasn't making much progress. Dad decided swap through a few of the local radio stations to see if there was any news of the traffic jam, maybe get an idea of how long we could expect the hold up. He really doesn't care for rock music so he ended up going between a couple of the country music stations. I stared at my Gameboy, trying to beat my high score on Tetris and not think about how bored I was while my sister was having a good nap. Mom was reading a book and would occasionally peak up to see confirm we weren't moving. After about 45 minutes of sitting at a stand-still, one of the stations finally chimed in with the details of the traffic. I wasn't really paying attention, we'd all assumed it was a wreck causing the back up. ""A fatal accident is blocking most of I-75 north involving 2 cars. The victims are reported to have been two children and anyone in the area is advised to avoid I-75 until they get it cleared up. We'll keep you updated as we find out more details. Here's Randy Travis's 'Forever and Ever'."" My mother was visibly upset. Her emotions seemed to swap between disbelief, a bit of curiosity but mostly sympathy for the kids. I think she even felt sorry for whoever caused it. I remember her saying how hard it's going to be for them to live knowing what they did. By the time we reached the scene of the accident the cars had been cleared and there were a few police cars blocking the lanes and workers from the city's road department cleaning up the debris left strewn about the road. Apart telling me not to stare, no-one really said anything. Once we made is past the accident, we were back up to speed and I had a feeling of relief. We still had several hours to go before arriving home and I don't remember any talk about the accident for the rest of the trip.

I held her until she stopped breathing. I guess the important thing about it is I have cried more about the dog than I have anyone in my life who has passed. She was my best friend and helped me get through so many hard times in the last 13 years. She was a part lab part german shorthair. She had a cropped tail and the most expressive eyes I have ever seen in an animal. She went everywhere I did and we weren't apart in the 13 years for more than a day. I think about her every day. She is buried in my garden in a spot she love to lay in while I gardened. Having a dog is big commitment and being with them at the end of their life is the hardest part. Saying goodbye while they slip away is a pain I have never known before. She was the best dog I have ever owned and I have had the pleasure of owning several good dogs. I have a new dog now but she will never replace my old girl. We were two peas in a pod. My heart breaks but I know I will see her someday again.,3.0,My dog passed away 5 months ago.

I finally decided to cash in some stock that I had and set up the trip for our 25 wedding anniversary.  I thought about it and chose the islands that I thought my wife would enjoy.  And I had one special island for me.  On Rangiroa 27 years ago I took many pictures of the black tip reef sharks, a very few with mine and many more with another person's camera.  I only had one that came out ok.  So I wanted my shark pictures.  We went to the airport early and took our first plane to Los Angeles and got on an afternoon flight to Papeete.  Our first island stop was Moorea, where we spent 7 days in an over water bungalow.  The Moorea of today saddened me because 27 years ago it was pristine and uncrowded.  Not now.  Next we went to Huahine, where we found the French Polynesia of 27 years ago.  Few cars and few people and absolutely beautiful.  I actually stayed in the same hotel that I had stayed in 27 years ago.  We had a great time there and rented a car to drive around the island. Bora Bora was our next stop and it was pretty much the same as it was 27 years ago.  It looks really nice flying in, but not so much on the ground.  We had decided not to get an over water bungalow there because it was too expensive.  But when we got there, we were moved into an over water bungalow at no additional charge.  We left after 3 days to my ultimate destination, Rangiroa.  We were staying a very nice hotel with our beach bungalow facing out to the crystal clear blue water.   Then on Sunday we went out to the Blue Lagoon where not only did I get shark pictures, I got shark videos.  I had tears in my eyes on the ride out because after 27 years I was finally going to get my shark pictures.  It was a rough ride, but we got to the blue lagoon and I was overjoyed. This was the trip of a lifetime and I only hope we can make it back one more time before we get too old.",1.0,We took a long awaited trip to French Polynesia after I had been there 27 years ago.

Two months ago was the last day of any actual work, and pretty simple work at that. Dr. Spiro needed his new officejet printer set up and I did the physical transportation and connection at his office before lunch. I logged in through our portal after hours to make sure it is visible on the network, but I already could see locally that everything seemed OK. I closed out a handful of open tickets and assigned my billable hours and all that jazz, but since everyone knew I was leaving for greener pastures I didn't have any new work assigned. That gave me a chance to start packing up my various gear and documents and software, but it took  another trip to pick up my monitor and tower.  I wonder if Gladys is still working there now, she has to be planning on retiring soon. I was glad nobody made any fuss about the departure, I'm not really the sort to want a farewell celebration. I hope Doug manages to do alright with his physical therapy, I saw him around town the other day from my car but couldn't stop to chat. That job was a good start to my working life, but ultimately both I and the boss knew I wasn't destined to remain there forever and it wasn't exactly headed in the direction I wanted to pursue. I'm ready to actually put my degree to some use now, and it will be refreshing to be rewarded and invested in a career direction I'm passionate about. I know I won't miss that blasted commute; it's hard to believe I drove that far every day considering how little I really wanted to be there. I wouldn't be surprised if the whole company went under in a year or two, but I wish the sinking ship good fortune and maybe it can be sold off/merged while still solvent and retaining valuable customers. It took a leap of faith to leave without guaranteed employment, but I think eventually the decision to stop heading down a dead end road was the right one, even if I don't know ultimately where I want to be heading. I know that I'm ready to fully apply myself to something I am actually passionate about and will reap the dividends my efforts sow.

It was a perfect excuse! We went to the mall and went into some of the store. She really didn't see anything she liked for a wedding. I told her it probably was because she wasn't in the mood for love type things right now. My friend said that right now she's not even thinking about spending  money on someone's wedding, she just hated the idea of love.

My friend told her that she was just cheated on by her long time boyfriend and for right now men are scum. I started laughing and told the woman to ignore her, she's upset. The woman told us it was understandable, but to not take his actions out on all men. She made a good point about our friend's marriage and how she must have found a great man that wouldn't cheat if she's willing to celebrate her love with everyone else. I was like ""She's got a point!"" My friend said, ""Ok, ok! You got me! We'll go and look for a dress now and I'll be a little less bitter about men...tomorrow!"" and we all laughed and the woman said to go to the dress shop down near Macy's. She said they had great dresses and they were reasonably priced and if we didn't mind dresses that had been worn before, they had great cheap dresses and the owner would probably give us a deal if we liked something but it was out of our price range.

Tomorrow, I will move back to the middle of the city and will be much closer to visit with my friends. It has been hard turning down offers to hang out for the evening or go out for drinks. I don't own a car, so making a 50 mile round trip to visit my friends for a few hours is quite a lofty proposition. Now that I live closer, not only can they come see me, I can get to them easier.

She tried her best to last as long as she could. She beat the odds every time it felt like and at times I thought she was simply invincible. Only way mom was going was kicking and screaming.

Simultaneously, I was looking at doing repairs and painting for to either sell myself at a higher price or through a realtor. I could do the work myself, with friends, or by hiring contractors. I preferred the latter. The problem was no one seemed to want the work! Two, maybe three contractors I contacted ghosted me by not showing up to give a bid. Was it the address? Holiday mood? I don't know, but it was frustrating. I had two friends who'd potentially help me knock out the work, but they wouldn't be available for a few weeks. It was stressful juggling all those options and not knowing which would pan out. Most would try one at a time, but I really wanted to get this settled and get out of town. Finally, I found some contractors through my neighbor. Those guys showed up the next Monday, knocked the work out for a low price and did very decent work. I was able to list the house and settled on an offer in 1-2 weeks, getting a decent sale price. Managing all that in a compressed time frame wore me out.

My parents had just gotten a divorce and my dad decided he wanted to move to Florida, leaving my mom, whom I didn't have the best relationship with, and I, in Atlanta, GA. I've always been a daddy's girl but I kept a lot from my dad to maintain my innocence in his eyes. Following my parents' divorce, I started hanging out later, I was drinking, I was using marijuana, and I was promiscuous. My grades suffered and I had begun spending time with multiple guys just for the fun of it. I was filling a void that my dad could no longer fill. Though I was spending time with multiple guys, I had strong feelings for one, Joshua. Joshua was smart, funny, a good listener, popular, handsome, a gentleman, and still a tough guy. I knew I was a lucky girl so eventually I dropped the other guys and committed myself to Joshua. But prior to commitment, I made the mistake of sleeping with both Joshua, and another guy, Corey, around the same time. Two months later, I realized my period was late, I was nauseous all of the time, and I had weird sensations in my body that were flu like. I told my best friend Ashley at the time about my symptoms and she told me that she would go to the dollar store with me the following day to get a pregnancy test since they were just as reliable as the name brand tests, but cheap. The next day, Ashley and I went to the Dollar Tree and purchased three pregnancy tests just in case I messed one up. I took the test at her house since her parents weren't home and I didn't want to risk running in to my mom at home. It was at this time that I found out that I was pregnant. I was scared, worrying about what I would do with a baby, and wondering whose baby it was. My mom was disappointed, I couldn't tell my dad myself that his princess was pregnant, and while Ashley was excited, it wasn't enough support to raise a baby. I needed stability, support, a job, personal growth, and I needed to finish school. My only hope was Joshua but he was not too happy about the fact that I was unsure of who the baby's father was and respectfully told me that he wanted nothing to do with me but that he would be a friend and see my decision to the end with me. Corey also wanted nothing to do with me, as far as he was concerned, I was a hoe. I felt like my only option was to terminate my pregnancy. I cried days before ending my pregnancy, during the process, and days following the procedure. I was broken, and I felt alone and helpless because I never wanted to have an abortion but I had no one. Now five years later, I find out that my dad would have been willing to help me raise my baby had he have known I was with child, but neither me nor my mom mentioned it to him. Though I was happy to hear that my dad would have had my back through whatever, I am heartbroken that I terminated my pregnancy out of fear, and I don't know how soon i'll ever be able to forgive myself.",3.0,I had an abortion at the age of 18 because I though I had no one that would help me out.

The supplement is also used to support liver function and help alleviate neuropathy.  Upon taking recommended a dosage, I developed back pain. As a scientist, I began scouring medical literature as well as watching biomedical presentations. I began a intellectual journey in learning about the body's mechanisms for detoxification. One of the most important scientists to help educate me in this area was Dr. Christopher Shade, CEO of Quicksilver Scientific (a company that specializes in biological testing of toxins and supply of carefully formulated nutriceuticals designed to help promote detoxification.  Through Dr. Shade, I bean to understand the body;s complex and intricately choreographed mechanisms for identifying, tagging, mobilizing, and eliminating toxins from the body. In addition, I learned about environmental factors that could lead to a block in detoxification. In my case, my medical history and symptomology supported a block in detoxification created by a significant exposure to toxic mold. As it turns out, mold biotoxins can block the body's ability to clear a number of toxins, including heavy metals, and that without removal of this block, use of other methods that stimulate portions of the detox process (such as alpha lipoic acid), may be hindered.  This can put undue stress on the liver and kidneys.  Fortunately, Dr. Shade also was instrumental in recommending a simple dietary remedy to this mold toxin-induced block to detoxification. After a very short amount of time, my troubles were greatly diminished. I am grateful to Dr. Shade for his knowledge  and insight, which has enabled me to proceed in a lifestyle of detoxification as well as identify mold biotoxin as a source of many of my chronic health issues.",2.0,"This story highlights my personal journey in discovery of the body''s innate detoxification processes, and how to overcome blocks to detoxification.",4444444.0

A struggle that made me stronger in the long run.  When I graduated from high school, I had no idea what to do with my life.  I took a job at a local diner frying up greasy food for obnoxious drunks and others, but the pay was poor and I was tired of living in my hometown.  I desired adventure.  I enlisted because someone told me that I could travel around the world and get paid good money and benefits without a college degree.  To make a long story short, the Army was no picnic.  I did my four years and decided to leave.  Don't get me wrong, I gained a lot in the military, but it didn't fit my personality.  I figured I'd take the money that I received for college and get that degree that I'd been avoiding.  Unfortunately, things didn't work out the way that I had hoped.  College wasn't for me either, so I dropped out after a series of failing grades and lack of interest in a major.  The college money from the military, as well as my savings,quickly ran out.  I ended up sleeping on the couches of friends and eventually, they got tired of me.  I got another greasy spoon job, but it didn't pay enough to afford rent, especially deposit and utilities.  I could have stayed at a cheap motel, but I figured I was better in the streets.  After being robbed a few times, and run off by cops, I decided to swallow my pride and go to a shelter.  The local city mission took me in, fed me a few times a day, and helped me find a better job.  Even though on the surface I was better, I was struggling with depression from my experiences and had a breakdown.  The shelter helped me to get some mental health treatment, and in six months I was ready to move into a small efficiency apartment.  I didn't have furniture, and I slept on a air mattress but it was mine and I could afford it.  In a few years, I had learned a trade, saved some money,  and moved to Florida a few months ago.  I have a good paying job, a much nicer apartment in a good neighborhood.

All of us together made the decision that it was time to free Elsa from her pain and take her to the vet to be let go.  All of us crammed into a tiny room that was filled with so much love.  Sure there were tears but there was also laughter and reminiscing.  It really felt like we were a family in that moment.  One dirty street dog helped me find a family that I didn't know I had.

We only paid so much attention until the men in the cars started to get out. There were a total of four men and we did not know any of them but they were placing all of their attention on us.

She said he doesn't give us any money and that he ran off with some younger women who is like half his age. I know she doesn't make a lot of money and she tries her best to get things for me but we're lucky if we actually have food in the house lately. She has to get her car fixed so she could get to work and that pretty much tapped her out for the next three months. She is a waitress so she said she'll pick up some extra shifts to get more tips to pay things off. I know she is trying her best and I can see why she is mad at Dad because he is supposed to be paying us for support. I just finally had the chance to sit down and write my thoughts as it's been crazy. Well, last week Dad called me and wanted to meet but he didn't want me to tell Mom. So he picked me up after school and we went for some ice cream. I was so nervous and scared as Mom always said mean things about him I didn't know what to expect. The only memory I have of him was when I was like three and he would take me for walks. I haven't seen him since then. He looked differently then I remember and he tried to give me a hug when he picked me up but that made me feel weird. Well, I wanted to write down and remember this day because I got a whole new perspective on my life. Dad sat me down with a chocolate sundae and opened up. He told me he had to leave mom because they were arguing all the time and they just fell out of love. He actually started crying and I felt really bad for him. I really want him back in my life so I gave him a big hug and told him I love him. He said we will work out a way to see each other and he will talk to mom. Since I am 18 Mom doesn't have much say about my life because I am an adult and if I want to see Dad then I will.  I'm feeling so much better about my life right now.",4.0,"My mother would always speak poorly of my father who was not in my life growing up, but we recently reconnected.

I was working at a hospital on the west coast—specifically, on the psychiatric unit. I had been assigned to a schizophrenic patient who had displayed severe aggression in his last admission. I had remembered this specifically from his last admission, and I thought I would be more prepared to handle him. Boy, was I wrong. In a matter of seconds after introducing myself, he jumped from his seat and grabbed my left arm. My shoulder dislocated nearly immediately, rendering me completely defenseless. Thankfully, he threw no punches at me, but he held onto my arms as I called for help. Eventually a nurse was able to push him back, and in that adrenaline rush I grabbed him with my good arm to take him to seclusion with the nurse. Somehow, with my dislocated arm, we were able to escort him to the seclusion room for unit safety. It is one of the craziest things I had ever experienced, and to this day I still have nightmares about it. Today, I still do not have 100% range of motion in my shoulder or arm, and I think that will be the case forever. It was a very bad thing to happen to me, and I am fortunate it did not get any worse. It is a crazy thing to remember as I write this and it still affects me emotionally.

The starter was beginning to act funny, and I knew I would need to do something soon, but I really wasn't prepared for this. It was my wife's idea. She's always the one that wants to spend the money in our house. The last one to work for it (she hasn't held a job in the nearly 5 years we've been married) and the first one to want to spend. What's ironic is that the day before, we had gotten into a humongous argument over, what else? Money. It's always the issue around here. But with that being said, it was a horrible idea to go looking at cars that day. We had made up from our argument, and of course I wanted to avoid upsetting her again. We ended up walking out of there with a 2018 hyundai sonata. Now it's a beautiful car by anyone's standards, the problem is it's about 200 dollars more than what we were paying off on our old car, and I still have about $8k left before I even pay that off. We had decided we would let that car get repo'd and just enjoy our new car. We'd make some simple lifestyle changes to cover the difference. We'd start eating food at home more, and my wife would stop drinking. One of those things happened. Want to guess what it is? I don't know if I can keep going on like this. She still refuses to get a job to help cover the costs. I just want her to do something. For all I care she can work part time on amazon like I do after coming home from my FULL TIME JOB!

I emailed the team who installed the pump to ask about this.  We were supposed to be pumping upwards of 10,000 gallons each week, so this was very low.  I also emailed the consultant to confirm his projections were still accurate.  The two were able to meet on site together, and I learned that we had been reading the wrong meter the whole time.  The meter we had been reading was the water we were using from the local water source, not our pump.  Our pump meter was somewhere else on site, and it turned out we were pumping almost the exact amount.

We've tried many different counselors, prayed over her, prayed for her, but nothing was working.  We finally agreed to let her try some medication.  While I was very concerned about giving an anti-depressant to a 19 year old child, we were kinda at our wit's end.  Living with her had gotten to the point that the entire house was on edge.  She was either asleep or yelling at us or ignoring us or being rude and nasty to every person in the house.    So the event I'm talking about happened about 6 weeks after she started taking the medication.  One day I realized that she'd come home from work and we'd had a 20 minute conversation in which she was lively, animated, and actually laughed.  I started realizing that she wasn't near as rude or mean or nasty as she used to be.  When I asked her to take out the trash, she just did it.  Without arguing, without putting it off and then forgetting, without any complaining, this was unheard of.  I was praising God and thanking Him for the nudge to try the medication with her.  It has changed her world, and therefore ours as well.  Recently she received word that although she got into her favorite college, she would not be able to go as the cost of room and board was just too much and we didn't feel like she should be drowning in student loan debt.  She was understandably upset but after about 10 minutes she started making other plans that involve living at home and going to a great school locally.  This would have never happened before the medication.  She would have retreated to her room and been in there for days, it would have crushed her, ruined her life in her eyes, and caused such upheaval that it would have taken weeks if not more for her to get back to baseline.  I'm beyond grateful for the advances in science, the doctors that know how to work with patients, and the God that provided for us all.",2.0,"My teenage daughter suffers from severe depression.

Then I notice some guy sits at the next booth and I sigh, annoyed that he doesn't seem interested in adhering to the basic social tenet of giving other people space in an otherwise large and empty restaurant. I can see out of the corner of my eye that he keeps turning his head to look back at me, and I brace myself for the inevitable encounter, probably another panhandler or some desperately lonely person looking for any type of social interaction, even with a complete stranger. My second theory turns out to be true, as he repeatedly turns in his seat to talk to me, succeeding in his attempts at insipid small talk while I give terse, disinterested answers. I live in the vain hope that my body language and preoccupation with my phone will eventually discourage him. I go to take a bite out of my breakfast sandwich and he turns around again, offering to buy me breakfast as he watches me chew. I stare at him, befuddled, finish chewing, swallow, and tell him no thank you before turning my attention to my phone, typing pointedly. He turns back, then minutes later turns back to me, and starts telling me a story about buying bread the other day. I have had it. I tell him I'm really not trying to be rude, but I'm just trying to eat my breakfast and take care of some work stuff. I wasn't in the mood to talk to anyone, sorry. He recoils, looks offended, and he repeatedly turns in his seat, then back at me petulantly, ranting about how he was just trying to be nice, he was just talking to me, I can't even be decent enough to talk to him? Because apparently I owe him conversation. I explain to him that I don't really care and to leave me alone. I can see a couple employees of the restaurant had sat down at one point, on break and/or checking in to see what was going on. I can see them watching quietly, trying to see if this escalates to the point where they need to intercede...again.

That's right, this is the second time in the last six months or so that I've gotten into an argument with a man who wouldn't leave me alone when I told him to. Apparently, he's had his fill, because he scrambles out of the booth, grabs his backpack, and starts retreating to the exit across the building. Again, he turns to walk away, stops, turns back to me, turns to walk away, turns back, rinse, repeat.

She was actually born early so she was considered a premature baby.  She had to be hooked up to machines and tested, so there was a lot of anxiety for the first couple of day afterwards. But everything turned out fine and I couldn't be happier!  I've been wishing for this for a while now since I will probably never have kids of my own. So this way I can live vicariously through them. I got to meet her a couple of days after she was born and it was super exciting. I couldn't believe how tiny she was.  She was so small, I was afraid to hold her. Even weeks after she was born I still wouldn't hold her because of how fragile she was.   I know I will be baby sitting a lot in the coming years and seriously am so excited to be able to watch this tiny human grow and learn!",4.0,I am an Aunt!

Then they said it was cancer. Apparently it started in his kidney and had already spread all over his body. It was also in his brain and some other places. Then I was really terrified. I bought a plane ticket home but when I landed I checked my phone and my dad had called. I listened to the message and he said my uncle had had cardiac arrest and died.

I had to run some errands and my sister was doing her own work related tasks. Now, this was the first time we had all been in the same area since the holidays, so it had been well over five months. We are not that sentimental as a family, but I could tell that my parents were really happy that we both could make it. We didn't really discuss too many emotional things, instead we strayed towards things like relatives, job talk, and diet talk. However, it never got contentious and everyone seemed like they were having a good time. I think the most memorable part of the event was just going shopping afterwords with my Mom to pick out different pastas and chocolate. I've gotten into cooking more in the past year, so I think my Mom was happy to discuss different ingredients with me. Overall, I had a good time, and it was a productive use of my day.

I introduced him to his instructor, walked away, and he just started crying! I had to physically leave the area because anytime he made eye contact, he would start to silently sob. It was heartbreaking, but I knew it was for the best. He needed to learn that he was safe with other teachers/lifeguard, as long as he followed their instructions and listened. This went on, more or less, for the entire session. I signed him up for session two, and he did so great! I walked him over to the instructor, gave me a kiss, and went with her. I sat across the pool from him, where he could see me, and instead of crying he would wave. He became more comfortable on his back and on his tummy, and is pretty much an expert (for a 2-year-old) at holding his breath. When swim lessons were done he would tell me that Sydney (his teacher) was very nice. When we would get in the car to come back the next day, he would say the same. Instead of being scared of the water, he was becoming a ""big boy"" and going in safely on his own. He was happy and joyful while in the water, and no longer scared at the thought of me not being in there with him. While he still wants me close by, he knows that this is for the best, too. And best of all is he is becoming a more confident person in the water.",1.0,My son's first experience with individual swim lessons. And expanding on how he did with session-2 of lessons.,90.0

I could not watch her anymore so I sat on a worn sofa in front of the ward, Jamie her best friend was there as well with  hospital chaplain who is a family friend. Jamie was crying, the chaplain was praying, and I was feeling utterly, nauseatingly helpless. I had never felt such shock, such numbing fear. My vision was blurred, my hearing seemed muffled, and I couldn't comprehend what was happening in the intensive care unit. The doctors aided my wife Katherine with an oxygen to help her out. I was so confused that I was no longer picking anyone's call because I did not want to loose my wife and unborn son. The doctors were really pumping air into wife saying you can do this try harder and I was hearing my wife screaming ral hard and this made me shed tears.  Did I really hear the doctor say ""CT scan"" I was so scared.

Some of them have months of recovery already, some have a few days, but it's always unique. Each person comes in with their own personalities, pasts, goals, strengths & weaknesses. A couple months ago someone who has worked with our house before had recommended a new guy to me. He explained to me that he was struggling in another house with other guys harassing him and making it hard for him to sleep. I took this new guy in without fully vetting him personally, because I trusted the person who was vouching for him. This turned out to be a mistake on my part, and a lesson learned. As it turned out, the problems he was having in his last sober living was related to the manic episode he was going through that our mutual friend was unaware of when he brought him to my sober living. For the next 3 weeks the entire house was on edge. He was abrasive, intense, and was always trying to do things his own way instead of following the rules. Most of these rules were little things that we give warnings about, we give people a chance to correct them, and because he didn't break any major rules I couldn't just kick him out. I COULD have, but I wouldn't feel right doing it, for something so small. As time went on it became clear to me that this was not going to change. We went to great lengths to give him a real opportunity to make it work at our house. He got on the right medication and was taking it, we were giving him plenty of 'growing room'. When it became apparent to me that this was going to be an issue, I decided I would give him advanced notice that we would not be accepting his next months fees and he should start looking for a new place to live. After hearing this, he tried to turn a new leaf - apologize to people in the house, apologize to me, but by then the damage had already been done and the people were incredibly uncomfortable living with him. A week went by and I reminded him that his time at our house was coming to an end. I made it very clear, but it was obvious to me he was not fully comprehending it, he was in deniable about the situation. On the last day I figured he would try to leave the house early to go to work and get home late, putting us in the uncomfortable position of having an argument and having to kick him out on the street in the middle of the night. I decided I would have to talk with him before he left. I heard him stirring around 3 in the morning, I told him that today was the day, he attempted a rebuttal and I reiterated that today was the day. He finally accepted the fact, and took out all his frustration about the situation out on me. He became very bitter, insulting me, calling me a 'F-ing coward' and left the house in a storm of anger.",3.0,I accepted a mentally unstable person into a sober living home that I manage.

So as my wife struggled to push the cord would constrict around our babies neck and her heart rate would plummit. This made everything very complicated and stressful. As time went on they prepped the operating room for an emergency C-section and told my wife she only had a couple more tries at natural birth. My wife had an emergency C-section on her first child many years ago so even this solution was dangerous. There was no real easy way forwards but my wife was determined not to have another C-section. something finally gave way and our baby started moving. They used a suction cup on her head to help the process along. Once everything started moving they still had to get the baby out far enough to remove the umbilical cord from her neck. There was a tense couple of pushes and I just remember feeling worried for them both. At last they got the umbilical cord removed and everything went smoothly from there.

She was fine at the treatment center, but once we got home she became violently ill.  She retched for hours and hours.  I felt helpless.

His is very much attached to his mom and I, so we were nervous for him being away from us. We figured his natural curiosity would carry him through the day until we would pick him up in the afternoon. We were wrong! The drop-off was tough. We were supposed to bring him in to his cubby, change his shoes to his slippers, and then help walk him over to the gate of his classroom. We saw the wheels turning in his mind - he knew what was happening and he didn't like it. The tears started as soon as he heard other kids starting to cry. He didn't want to let go of us and he looked like he could not understand why were leaving him with the teachers at the school. We were told that we should make a quick exit upon dropping off, so as to not prolong the experience for him, but it was difficult! After we got back to our car and were on our way home, we saw that the teacher had sent us a picture of him in the classroom, already taking an interest to some of the class materials and activities for him. The day was long and when we went to pick him up that afternoon, he looked worse for wear! Even though he looked relieved to see us he started to cry again. The teacher told us he had a fine day and that every day would get a little easier. We trust her, but the process has been difficult so far! It's hard to drop him off (now on his second week) knowing that it is so emotionally upsetting to be left at school in the morning!",5.0,My diary entry is about my youngest son's first day at nursery school and our experience with dropping him off.,14.0

After calling me, she rushed him to the emergency vet who he has been seeing for years, where they found out he had a hole in his cornea. Luckily, since it was found quickly, they were able to do surgery to save the eye. I still had a few days left on my trip, which I tried to enjoy, but it was hard.

I traveled all around the world, and even took one of those 28 day cruises across the Mediterranean down around India to Australia! I had been yearning to travel for a while, and now that I have seen so much in the last year, the world has certainly been a lot smaller. My first stop was in Europe. Specifically, Paris. While I started there, most of what I saw was just too touristy. Everything was extremely overpriced and I just wasn't feeling the culture, so after two weeks in Paris, I took a train across Europe intending on hitting as many cities as possible. About halfway through my trip, I found myself in Rome. Now Rome is incredibly beautiful and culturally rich. I really enjoyed seeing the Colosseum, and for the most part, it seemed less tourist based than a few of the other cities I encountered. I just really like the culture and history of the Roman period, so learning about that was fantastic. It was kind of crazy to consider how much of our society is structured around the politics of the Roman Republic. I was able to schedule a cruise while I was there, and it picked us up on the Italian coast. We went from Italy through the Mediterranean, making quite a few stops along the way. I think there were about 12-14 excursion ports? It was a very long trip that ended in Australia. While I was in Australia, I met a woman who had a wildlife sanctuary and she invited me to her place to see the kangaroos and koalas she had been rehabilitating. I had never seen a koala up close and personal before but she said they can be a little grouchy. I didn't have a chance to experience a grouchy koala though because they were all drugged up on eucalyptus. I stayed in Oz for about a month, and then I ended my travels by going to New Zealand and then Thailand before catching a flight back home. It was an incredible and unique experience that helped me relate a bit more to numerous cultures and people. I'm so glad I went.",1.0,Went a a trip to see various places intentionally.

It's perfect for my husband and I, and our small daughter.  Since I bought it, I have been buying all kinds of accessories for it, to customize it and make it a little different from all of the others on the road and trails.  We have big tires, have lifted the suspension, have added red accessories, and some custom lights.  I totally love it.  We have also been able to join a Jeep club, filled with other Jeep owners and lovers in our area.  Every weekend, some members of the club meet together for a cookout or for a trail ride.

I had only been married a short time (under a year), but I asked for a divorce and separated from my then-wife. This separation occurred around the holidays, so it was especially lonely and depressing. Having to spend Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years alone was a very dark thing to experience, very lonely. I had a great support system, and got myself into some healthy habits (gym, therapy, hobbies), but it was still an incredibly difficult time in my life. There were times when I wasn't sure things would ever get better. My divorce was finalized five months after separating, and I knew I needed to take the time to be single and get myself in a good place before I started dating again. As luck would have it, right when I started feeling like ""myself"" again, I met a wonderful woman. I am still with her to this day, and have a strong, fulfilling, and satisfying relationship. In the end, I learned that although I went through a dark time, all bad things will eventually pass as long as you're willing to put in the hard work to see them through. In going through the pain of a separation and divorce, I learned to appreciate not only myself, but my girlfriend. The little things she does seem so much more meaningful and important, because I came from a bad relationship where I had none of them. I now know what it's like to feel love and respected, but first, I had to learn to love and respect myself. That's something that could only come from recovering from a divorce.

That is something that I have done.,"I grew up in the bible-belt in a rural town in America.  I was raised by my mother and her parents.  They were devout Southern Baptists, and I was raised to be the same.  As I got older my views about the origins of the world and humanity changed quite a bit.  I grew to believe in the things I was being taught in my science and history classes rather than the religious stories that my family repeated over and over.  None of this changed my love for my family and I never felt the need to let them know that my views about religion had changed.  Not only would they be hurt, they would be down right frightened for my everlasting soul.  It would be a real big deal, and since it doesn't harm me in any way to pretend that I still agree with their religious beliefs, I just let it go.  They're not going to change their minds, and I'm not going to change mine.  This is a situation where ignorance really is bliss for all parties involved.  I even still go to church with my family when I'm home.  I enjoy catching up with people I've known since childhood.  The social gathering remind me of growing up, and even if I don't believe I can still enjoy a great church potluck. So six months ago I was home for a couple of weeks and I went to one of those lunches with my family and I was introduced to Sue.  Sue and I hit it off in a big way.  We spoke for hours that day and ended up having coffee and then dinner together before I left town.  We text each other daily and talk on the phone often, and I've made a couple of trips back home just to spend more time with her.  That chance meeting has evolved into a relationship, but, even though Sue and I have similar backgrounds, we don't share the same beliefs.  Unlike me, Sue does believe in God and she's every bit as involved with her religion as my family is.  I haven't told Sue that I don't share her Christian beliefs.  I think that's going to be a deal breaker for her and I'm just not sure what to do at this point.  Maybe there would have been a chance for us if I had been honest from the beginning.",4.0,"This entry is about how my girlfriend and I got together.

My wife was under a lot of physical and mental stress, and I was eagerly waiting for labor day, but I was fearful yet excited. It's a feeling I'm not sure if I will feel again, especially when my wife went into labor. I didn't know what was going on -- it felt like adrenaline running through my veins and I felt frantic but also that I knew exactly what I was doing and what needed to be done. I was there to support my wife at all steps and I wished most in the world for the healthy birth of my son and that my wife would be alright. When he was finally born, I remember making a look of shock and awe to my wife, especially when she handed him to me to hold. It was crazy to think that my own son was in my hands, and only a few months back I never had any time of feelings like this. I was almost overwhelmed, but my wife and I always wanted a family, and this had been years in the making. Honestly, some of my first thoughts were, ""Can I do this? Am I going to be a capable father?"". My wife helped me put those thoughts to rest quick, and the joy of having my son around drowned out those types of thoughts quickly when my family and my wife's family showed up to support us, as well as our friends. The amount of support was really incredible. I don't think we had to buy a thing for 3 months as people came in in droves to support us it seemed.

Ever since he died things have been quiet at home. We try not to being him up much and when we do, we smile and then immediately get saddened that we can't hear just one more joke. He and a few friends had been involved in an accident with a drunk driver who is now in prison, this wasn't his first DUI but we are praying it is his last. I hope they put him away for a long time. My brother's life wasn't the only one that was lost that night. Two other individuals from his basketball team were in the car with him, twins to a single mom who lives just down the street. I see her from time to time when I ride my bike around the neighborhood. She looks sad, lonely. I know just the feeling. My brother was the only one who didn't make me feel invisible.

It was an open-handed, angry slap on the face. Followed by frozen shared-shock. It all started when we were arguing over who should be doing what tasks around the apartment. I was living with her for a few months until I could get on my feet, because I was new to the city. And at a distance, with enough time between interactions- the bossy, assured nature she would dictate our time together in, was almost a comfort. I really liked having her be that for us, and I think she really enjoyed having me being compliant and helpful. But when a few times a month became everyday, the tension began to build. Perhaps I would offer to take the dogs out a few days she was busy getting ready in the morning. Then the next week she would ask me every day to take her dogs out and to also feed them. When the clothes sitting in the washer were blocking me from doing my laundry, I would go ahead and finish out her loads of laundry. Then the next week she would ask me to do her laundry for her. It would even be things that weren't house care related. If she didn't want to be alone doing something, she would ask me to accompany her to do it-perhaps watching her hang up her clothes, or sit with her while she studied. Well one particular night it came to a head when she asked me to come help her clean up the kitchen. I had not dirtied up the kitchen, and I didn't want to clean it up. And when she would ask for help doing something-you can bet that meant I was just going to do most if not all of it, and she absolutely used that to her advantage. But this night, I said no. She was so taken aback by this that she got angry with me. I was so offended that she would get mad that I declined to help on this ONE thing that it escalated quickly over the next 40 minutes. We started kitchen-sinking, mudslinging, slandering, defaming each other just specifically calling out every minuscule problem we had with each other over the past month. Until eventually we got up in each other's faces and she slapped me across the face. It's been about 4 months since then, and we still haven't spoken.

Until the shrink felt that I had mastered some coping mechanisms and showed some progress, they put me on Admin Leave.  All my buddies treated me like I was a bomb ready to explode at any moment - it was humiliating and frustrating.  As a matter of fact, even now, I don't keep up with many of them.  My wife and I separated - she was pregnant with our first child at the time - it was gut-wrenching.

I find it beneficial and therapeutic to write out these experiences. I believe that writing everything out is the only real way that I can begin to heal from these events. It was only a short time ago that I got evicted from my apartment. There were several reasons why I got evicted. The first and most direct reason I would say is that my roommate, Cole, moved out unexpectedly. He truly just got bored with living there and made way too much money illegally and not nearly enough money legally. It definitely took a toll on the household. He wasn't pulling his weight and he truly hated that I wanted him to get a real job. So he moved out and that was that. Unfortunately, he left less than a week before rent was due and so I was stuck paying for all the rent plus my other bills. I tried making a payment plan with the front office that ended up not working. When I was served with an eviction notice, I really went into denial and thought I could save the apartment rather than take immediate action and go out looking for a new place to live. So when it came time for court, I was told I had a week to vacate. I couldn't afford or find a new place in time and I was moving my things out of the apartment at the very last second. The problem was that I felt responsible for my safety, my fiance's safety, and the safety of my two cats. Yet I had nowhere to go. We had to take all of our belongings to a storage unit and stay in our car. We drove a PT Cruiser at the time and luckily it was pretty roomy after taking out the back seats and building a little bed area in the back seat. We made a litter box for the cats that we could put a lid on when not in use. It was hard because I felt like such a failure that couldn't even take care of my family. This went on for well over a month of having to find places to park at night and sleep, find food, brushing my teeth and washing my hair in public bathrooms, and hoping that I can find places to shower or do my laundry. The stress got to me and I wasn't sure I could even keep going. Now I'm living with my in laws and slowly trying to rebuild my life. The only real downside is their aversion to the fact that I'm a woman dating their daughter.",5.0,"I was evicted unexpectedly from my apartment leaving me, my future wife, and my two cats had to live in our car for two months.

One of my favorite memories of that day was being seated alongside several of my friends, where we could see the newlywed couple together. None of us had seen my cousin dress so nicely before. In fact, most of us knew him as a fairly slovenly man, who rarely shaved and often had messy hair. His appearance become a source of merriment for us and we soon began making jokes about the way he looked. One friend adopted a rigid demeanor and did a funny impression of my cousin. Another friend, my cousin's old college roommate, found some old pictures of my cousin on his cell phone and used an app to stitch together some pictures from college with pictures from that day to make a series of ""before and after"" photos. A third friend remembered my cousin telling him that he would never wear a suit in his life and we all laughed at that recollection. When my cousin and his wife made their way to our table, we shared the jokes with the couple. His wife found my friend's impression of my cousin to be especially humorous. My cousin laughed when he saw the before and after pictures, though I think he may have been a little embarrassed, too. Still, despite that embarrassment, he knew everything was in good fun and without malice. When I think back to that day, the joking we shared at that table was is my most vivid memory. I suspect my friends would agree. I think that is why my cousin and his wife sat us all together that day.

When I arrived, my aunt picked us up from the airport in Naha, Okinawa in a rental car and drove me to her house. I got to greet my uncle and cousins, but it was around 10 PM by then so we quickly went to bed. The next day was a week day, so my aunt and uncle had to work. My other aunt came to pick us up and we visited her house. We played with her dog and watched a bit of TV and then went out to eat. That afternoon we went to the local community center for a family party. Everybody on her side of the family was there; my aunts, uncles, cousins, and even my grandma's sister who is 98. My parents and I briefly talked with everybody and were happy to catch up with them and learn how much everybody had accomplished. It was odd to see my cousins all grown up after I hadn't seen them for years. After a while my uncle made an announcement to welcome my parents and I back to Okinawa. After that, my other uncle and my cousin (his daughter) did a musical performance for us. They played the sanshin, which is a traditional Okinawan instrument similar to the Japanese shamisen. The first song was a traditional song from the city Kitanakagusuku where they lived. During the next song, my aunt and my grandma's sister did a traditional Okinawan dance with fans. Once the performance was done, we had a buffet-style dinner which was provided by different members of the family; I felt emotional once I learned they had all worked together to cook us a traditional Okinawan meal. There were many different dishes so I knew it had probably cost them a lot and taken a long time to make. Since Okinawa is one of the poorer areas of Japan, this really meant a lot to me. Then my grandma's sister gave a speech about how thankful she was for my grandma, since my grandma did not go to school and instead worked to provide for her family ever since she was young. My grandpa had also recently passed, and she talked about him, which made me start to cry. Following this, my aunt gave a similar speech telling us how much she missed my grandma and how happy she was that we went to visit them in Japan. It made me sad again, as we wanted to bring my grandma but she did not want to deal with the hassle of traveling now that she is older. I thought about how much she would've enjoyed to see the same places she knew as a child and how she would've been so happy to meet her family that she hasn't seen in decades. Once the speech was over, we ended the night on a happy note by doing a traditional Okinawan dance all together.

Our last loss was a third trimester loss, two days before my due date. Everything looked great through the pregnancy and I thought ""this is it, finally! we made it to the end safely"", until those dreams were shattered just as quickly as they pregnancy progressed. We discovered at a routine non stress test that the baby had no heartbeat and had passed from a cord accident. Even though each loss prior to this had been difficult, this was the worst.

It came time to leave and I headed out to the restaurant we were meeting at. I got there pretty much as she got there and we took our seats at the table. We both ordered and then talked while we were waiting for the food to come out. I thought we were at least somewhat making a connection, since we had some similar interests. I learned enough about her that I definitely would have gone on a second date with her if she wanted to. The conversation died down a bit when the food came out because we were both pretty hungry.  As we were both getting down eating I had to use the restroom, so I excused myself. The floors must've been wet in the bathrooms or by our table because as I was walking back I slipped and fell face first into our table. I landed right on the corner and busted my forehead open and started bleeding. As if that wasn't bad enough, I also spilled what was left of our dinners and drinks onto both of us. I started apologizing right away to the girl, but there is only so much apologizing while having a busted open forehead can do. I ended up going to the hospital and getting stitched up.

Traveling on the highways makes me nervous because of all the unexpected stresses that can happen but I set that aside and bought the tickets.  In anticipation of some stresses I tried to mitigate that by purchasing the special up close and determined parking, and a fast pass so I wouldn't have to wait in line.  I even surprised myself by driving the whole way to the city.  I drove to the otherskirts of the city to a place we planned to eat.  From there things got stressful because parking was difficult, and it was a busy pedestrian area.

I also hate to be the cause of conflict. So here I am, at work, feeling queasy from morning sickness (I’m 8 weeks)And I get a message from DH’s Aunt. She asks me if I had anything planned for my birthday which is in about 3 weeks. I figure she’s just organising her families calendar, so I say “nothing as of yet, when I do it might just be low key pizzas at our house” (We are actually organising something so we can announce we are pregnant to his family!)And she writes a spiel about her MLM (I forgot she was involved in) and how she can host a party for me and my friends and it will be loads of fun and we will get loads of freebies and blah blah blah. And I instantly get a cold sweat, I wonder how I can explain to her that I’m fundamentally against supporting MLMs without pissing her off, if it’s less hassle to just let her throw one, while also being irritated that she would even ask.  Every invite I’ve received from her so far on FB, I’ve just ignored, hoping she wouldn’t notice me among all the other women she invited. Then the hormone monster took over for a second, and I  wrote “No, thank you” and hit send. And she wrote back “Oh, OK” And that’s it!

I had placed her car seat inside my shopping basket and we were touring the health food section. Suddenly my phone rang and an unfamiliar voice said, “This is your father’s apartment manager. There’s been an emergency.” All I could think was that my dad had probably been taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital or something. So I asked the woman, “Are they taking him to the hospital by ambulance? What hospital are they taking him to?” Then the woman replied, “No, he’s not going to the hospital. Your father has passed. Just try to get here as soon as you can.”All of the sudden I just felt overcome with panic.

You don’t really know what an adrenaline rush feels like until you’ve either been in a life or death situation, or at least experienced what your mind considers to be the emotional equivalent. I swiftly swung my daughter’s car seat in to the back seat of my SUV in a single motion. I drove with little regard for speed limit or traffic lights right to the bank down the street where my husband was working at the time.  When I finally reached the bank I swung open the double glass doors as quickly as I could. I spotted my husband sitting quietly at his desk. There were some customers waiting in the lobby, but honestly I couldn’t have cared less. As soon as my husband noticed me I spoke the only words that I could think of at the time . “Mark! My dad… My dad died.” Losing a parent is incredibly painful. Part of your identity dies. Nobody else remembers your childhood with the same sentiment.

I spent my first weekend away since giving birth to my son and I really needed it. He is 18 months and was with my boyfriend, his father the whole weekend. When I came back Sunday afternoon, I saw that my son's toe was really red. I was worried about it and he kept pointing to it, even though he could not talk, I could tell it was bothering him. We called the doctor on the video call to try and see if they would give us some advice and ultimately we had to go into urgent care. We only had 20 minutes before the urgent care would stop taking patients so by that time I rushed over and got him checked in. I was so worried it would be something bad. Since it was his big toe, worst case scenario, he would lose it and never be able to walk right again. Turns out it was just cellulitis which is an infection but nothing severe. We were given antibiotics for my little man and went on our way. A few days later our son wakes up from his nap with a hot of red bumps and spots all over his body.

Once I made it over the bridge, I needed to go left at the intersection. I knew I made a bad call when I didn't signal. The other bikers were expecting me to signal, but I didn't do it. At the time it just slipped my mind but I regret it now. I am a person that can often get mad when other bikers never do it themselves. I was one that didn't. In the future I will change my ways.

Therefore those little creatures are the real devil due to the fact how they can poison anything that is touched and bite yourself, therefore appearing uninvited to a wedding event is the worst gift we the guests and the people who are marrying can experience ever. It sure scared the guts out of me and the snake itself was very ugly and probably one of the poison types that if we were not careful means that it can bite anybody that is on it's way and it can be deadly consequences to all the rest of us.

It could have been anything a spider, shark or even a group of wild monkeys. But for god sake why snakes. Oh well at least I got to enjoy the gourmet food that was made on the wedding fresh and from scratch, which was delicious by the way. Therefore I ate as much my stomach could handle.

One day I sprained my ankle while running and injured it pretty badly. Because I had no insurance at the time, I could not get it seen to by a doctor. Anyway, fast forward 4 decades (I'm 64 now) and have bone on bone arthritis in my right ankle joint. I was in a lot of pain daily and was having trouble walking any distance. So, in April of this year I, found a doctor who actually does ankle REPLACEMENT surgery. Now, prior to about 5 years ago, this was unheard of and the only thing available was a fusion of the ankle bone, which is probably why I did not have anything done earlier. The surgery is so new, that there are no predictions as to how long the joint will last, because there is no long term data yet. But, in April I took the plunge and had my right ankle replaced. Although the recovery is said to last up to a year (I'm 4 months in), I am walking without pain for the first time in years. I was unable to bear weight for one month and have had three months of physical therapy retraining my ankle to walk again. I still have a long way to go to recover my balance when walking and doing the kind of hiking and walking I love to do, but I feel it will all be worth it in the long run. When I have fully recovered, I should have 98% mobility in my ankle, which is a far cry from a fusion. I am very thankful I waited for the right time and technology to come along.

I enjoyed a little bit of Volbeat which is another hard rock type of band that has catchy songs. Then the best of all, Slipknot was due to go on after a good break. The intensity of the intro they play off their second album was immense. I pretty much lost my voice and was sweating from jumping the whole time.

I often think about buying a home with her and starting a little family and I know deep down inside of my self that is what I want and I wouldn’t be happier with anyone else besides her.

I felt that my soccer season was over and this was something serious. I tried to ice the area to keep the swelling down, but that was obsolete. I knew i had to go to the emergency room right away. At the hospital they confirmed that it was an achilles rupture, but instead of surgery i may need to wear a cast for six weeks. During this time the tendon will grow back together. The doctor had me in the cast and told me it will be changed every two to three weeks to help stretch the tendon. I have leg brace splint that keeps me from moving my foot to prevent further injury.

She was the kind of person that was a bit reserved, but we convinced her to have the party after a bit of prodding and promising not the go too far (*fingers crossed*). The setting for the party was a hotel in a nearby town, and about 20 people were there to celebrate. As soon as the person of the night came, the drink were being slung, and the party was jamming. It was about 70 minutes into the party that things started to get a bit crazy. One of our friends saw when she came into the hotel that a buggy was parked in the parking lot of the hotel. We all thought it would be fun to leave the hotel room and to drive around town enjoying the starry night sky.  We didn't have a care in the world at that point, and the bride-to-be was completely into the whole thing. I'd never seen her as into something as she was at that moment sitting next to me in that buggy driving through town in the dead of night.  But things soon turned a bit serious when we ran into a group of guys returning from a hike. These were college aged guys, so they were young and, admittedly, a bit handsome. They saw how tipsy we were and probably thought we were an easy lay. Alcohol and cautious thinking don't mix, so a few of our friends who were very drunk decided to go with the guys to party before heading home. It  wasn't until the next morning that we heard what happened. Apparently, they woke up feeling like they were given something other than alcohol. They fear that they may have been assaulted, so they went to the police to file a report.

I volunteered at places and went to support centers to show my support. These days I go to the park and just draw with my notebook, Nature and Animals.

And it seemed like there were so many people that worked there that were just running back and forth incredibly busy. It was like a shopping mall except there was something nuts about it!

When confronted about the video, he promptly removed it and tried to tell me that I was exaggerating the contents. Unfortunately, it was very clear that the two were intimate with each other. I found this to be heartbreaking because I have spent tens of thousands of dollars and flown back and forth from the States to Europe on multiple occasions to bring myself and our son to him over the last year. During a phase in our marriage where I thought that there was no obstacle we could not overcome, I was absolutely blindsided by this happening. Moreover, to deal with ICE, immigration court, physical deportation, flying across the world with a toddler in tow, the expense of maintaining two households, only to have my marriage end over something so much ridiculous, is highly frustrating on many different levels. The aftermath of this situation has been constant bickering, anxiety, and loss of sleep. Furthermore, I have come to realize that this man is not the man I thought he was. The financial cost has been an approximate loss of $3500 since I had already secured our return tickets. Psychologically, I am frustrated because I have had to deal with immigration laws while securing permanent residency overseas, which will obviously no longer be happening.

I left and went and picked up my prescriptions. I sat at home by myself staring into the nothingness of my emotions thinking about what will become of me and my newly discovered disease. I turned on a gospel sermon to listen to and coincidentally it the sermon had to do with unforeseen circumstance and how to deal with them. The pastor said that ""these circumstances aren't here to hold you back; but here to propel you forward to your purpose.""

Even though they were nice, none of these campgrounds compare to the remote and dispersed campgrounds found off of forest roads. The overall privacy and being alone with nature is ultimate experience when it comes to camping. Being able to find a site next to a mountain creek and do some garnet or ruby hunting is one of my most favorite things in life. I will definitely return soon to take advantage of these campsites. The mountains will always be my most favorite travel destination.",1.0,My most memorable event on this vacation was the exploration of forest roads.

I mean, I never met a medical waiting room I liked, but at least in a doctor's office or the emergency room, there are other people, things happening, a sense of progress. Surgical waiting rooms are separate, special, and if you're in one in the middle of the night it's just your group, alone, waiting for news. It makes funerals feel good. With my sister's brain cancer in some ways, it's a little bit like we never got to leave that room. The outcome of her surgery wasn't bad. It turned out that her cancer was much less aggressive and serious than they originally believed. It wasn't good either, though. The tumor was in a dangerous spot, and they couldn't safely remove it. So we're back to normal now, and for the most part, everything is great, but in some sense, we're still just waiting. This has all been much worse for Sarah, of course, so I completely understand that she's been determined not to let this whole thing dictate how she lives. More than that, maybe. I'm not sure she isn't to some degree making decisions just to prove that she isn't letting herself be limited. That's a little scary, the idea that just maybe her choices are based more on pushing her boundaries rather than doing what's really best for her. She's excited about her new job, though, and I'm certainly not going to try to tell her she shouldn't take it. There are great doctors in Amsterdam, too, and she seems confident that she's got the insurance all figured out.

Unfortunately, there is no pay for this, but the idea is that the experience will pay for itself. Once of the classes I had to take was Microbiology. The class itself was tough, and a little confusing. It was essentially a long list of organisms, and the media that is used to grow the organisms. So, a lot of memorization. Now, and for the past six weeks or so, I have been doing my clinical rotation in the Microbiology department. The surprising thing that I have found is that the job itself isn't nearly as confusing as the class led me to believe that it would be. Granted, there is a massive amount of knowledge that is required to be known, but there are tons of reference materials at hand, and the use of them is heavily encouraged. The job is basically a desk job. I did not expect that. The employees in the Microbiology department work at one of six stations. The stations determine the type of work that will be performed for that day. The work that they will be doing for the day is laid out in front of them at the beginning of the shift, and once it is completed, they are basically finished working for the day, and just do extra things until the shift ends.

What surprises us the most is how mature and excited she is about the entire thing! It makes us happy because my wife and I both remember dreading school in our early years. Fortunately she has been very social since preschool and is always looking forward to the next day with all of her friends and teachers. Also, unlike her parents, she is a morning person and is usually the first one awake asking to get ready to go to school. Her friends also seem to enjoy school as much as she does so that probably helps with her attitude. Just after the first week of school we are noticing improvements in several areas. She has been typically stubborn with reading every night, but she has been doing better at sounding out words. She also seems more motivated to write and practice her numbers and math. Her teachers have told us they believe she is a very smart girl, and she will very likely excel in school. We absolutely believe she will.

We were both really nervous and on edge when we applied, our credit scores have been suffering lately since we racked up a little credit card debt on top of our student loans. But even in spite of our credit, we ended up getting the place we really wanted. We looked for so long and finally found just the right place, I mean we knew we would have to downsize our things coming from a house, but we just knew it would be worth it. The new place is so walkable, our neighbors are interesting and the place is gorgeous and just our style. The problem started though when we really got into downsizing. I thought it was going to be so much easier than it was, we were arguing all the time about who had to throw out what. There was a lot of resentment and hurt feelings, because naturally, the things that aren't yours don't mean much to you. So when I saw Derek's skis that he hadn't used for nearly two years I was determined to make him get rid of them. Why would we need skis in South Carolina?? We never take those kinds of trips. Or any trips really, so that started another fight about how we never travel anymore and it just became a huge mess. Who knew that something so seemingly insignificant as throwing out some clutter could bring up so many unrealized problems? I really saw how bitter I was about not traveling anywhere aside from our family homes and feeling like we were becoming boring. Really, this apartment and it's proximity to some excitement and nightlife was the hope on the horizon. The only obstacle being that we were at each other's throats and still loaded down with junk. I made a lot of concessions and threw out so many things, and unfortunately I threw out things out of resentment too. I regret tossing my white linen blazer. Who cares if he thought it looked silly? I really liked it. Anyway, we ended up getting through it all and moving into our dream house (apartment). I really love this new place, and I've been walking or riding my bike everywhere. I found a great new coffee shop that makes the most perfect peppermint mocha I've ever had, I found a little pub a few blocks away that has some killer bar food and great ambiance, and the shopping around here is perfect. This is exactly how I've always wanted to live, and it seems surreal that I get to have it now. The only thing I'm missing is my amazing relationship with Derek. Ever since our downsizing debacle we've been a little bitter and petty, hopefully everything will get back to normal soon and I can take him to all the great places I've found.",1.0,My partner and I were approved for our first apartment.

It all started early on a Monday morning at work. Typically Monday and Sunday are the most stressful days for me because of my dislike about being stuck at work for the week and that the weekend had ended. So generally I am at least a little more stressed those days than others. That morning I also had received a couple voicemails about a couple bills that had been paid for a non-profit that I am part of. Looking back it was an honest mistake because we restructured the organization and thus needed to also change the bank accounts. Generally we had a treasurer that took of those things, but once we had restructured he had left so I was in charge. Unfortunately, though I had very little idea as to what accounts we had out there and what we paying for and how we were doing so. But at the time being in the accounting industry it was stressful because in my own life I am very good at paying bills and always worry about missing something. Those calls got my stress level up to a certain point, but elevated even more was realizing that during a transition period of acquiring a person's work I failed to bill a tenant for several months. Even though I talked to my manager about it and we worked it out it still got my stress level up even more and eventually over the edge. It was around noon that I noticed that I was real jittery and issues typing or even talking. Things seemed to be serious to the point that I took of work and went to the hospital. Upon check-in they believed I may have actually had a stroke so they announced a stroke code upon which several doctors came and gave me a blood transfusion and several tests. Once that was all over though I began to calm down and feel much better.  In the end they did a couple radiology tests, which came back negative and they believed I probably did not have a stroke after all. It was only later that after thinking about it more that I thought it was more of a panic attack. So I am trying to do better about managing my stress levels and am thankful that I had been given a clean slate as far as my health.",4.0,Two months ago I had a situation while at work that a hospital thought initially might have been a stroke.

Because my siblings had already left the house and I was going to be leaving for college the following fall, my parents were ready to downsize. It was an emotional decision because my siblings and I had been raised in this home and my parents had lived there before any of us were even born. So last winter we set our sights on fixing anything that needed fixing in order to put our home up for sale. This included painting the walls, a new roof, and new siding in some areas. At the end of winter, our house was ready for the real estate market. We were all very anxious about putting the house on the market. My parents began looking for a new place to live and my siblings and I were trying to imagine a world in which we did not come home to the house we had grown up in and made so many memories in. After a couple of months on the market and a price drop, the home finally had an offer at the beginning of summer. But that is also where the headache began for myself and my parents. The people who put in the offer made too many demands including leaving some furniture and appliance items that we had planned to take with. After we conceded to some of what they wanted, the process of them getting verified to actually by the house turned in to a long drawn out process. In fact, mid way through summer my parents were just ready to be done with it as they had envisioned it going much smoother. My parents had to resign documents many times and were continuously told that the final offer might not go through, so they were stuck between purchasing their new home or waiting. Finally, at the tail end of summer, just as I was heading off to college, the offer went through and my parents were given 30 days to leave the home. By that point, I was already preparing to leave for college so it didn't seem to take as much of a toll on me as I thought it would. My parents were so fed up with how the process went, that they too were ready to say goodbye. Looking back on it, the home really didn't get the emotional goodbye I thought it should.",4.0,"We moved out of our family home this past summer.

This party was taking place in a brand new home that was built in a very small and close-knit town.  As the night went on the party started to wind down and almost everyone had left.  Pat was going to find our friend in the backyard to say goodbye and I went inside to find our other friend to thank her and say goodnight, but she was already asleep upstairs so I went back outside and headed towards my car.  On my way down the dark driveway I was surprised to see a person pace down in the gravel. I got our my phone to use the flashlight and discovered it was Pat, and he was injured badly.  His head had a huge gash and he was bleeding and not very responsive.  I called 911 and gave the dispatcher all of the information I could, but I did not know the address, nor was I familiar with the town or any landmarks.  It took a long time for the paramedics to arrive, and when they started to treat Pat I was approached by 4 sheriffs who wanted to ask me questions.  I tried to give them as much information as I could, but since I was inside when the incident happened I really had no idea how Pat ended up in the state he was in.  Soon, the sheriffs started accusing me of assaulting Pat.  They questioned the homeowners who could not provide any information because one was asleep, and the other was at the far back side of their property cleaning up and putting out the fire we had going earlier.  Nobody heard or saw a thing.  So the natural conclusion for the officers was that I had a baseball bat and bashed in Pats face in the dark driveway.  I was treated like a criminal, and was not able to go with Pat to the hospital or even know what hospital they were taking him to.  Finally, with no evidence or baseball bat weapon to be found, the sheriffs let me go with a stern warning that the case was not closed and they would be watching me closely.  I found what hospital Pat was in, was able to speak to him after treatment, and found out that he had tripped on a tree root in the dark on his way to find our friend and hit his head on a rock.  The doctors and nurses even showed my the bits of gravel they had to dig out of his head.  From that night forward, and even still to this day, the sheriffs drive by my house continuously, often parking nearby and watching me as I go about my day.

We are constantly pulling in there and roaming around the whole area, but we very infrequently meet other dogs and their owners while we are in the back woods area of the park. A few months ago, in the spring of this year, we were following the same course as always and we came upon a dog running loose with a collar and tags on its neck. It stopped and was friendly, then continued along the way by itself. Shortly after, me and my dog ran into the owner of the one we had just met, and he was walking another dog on a leash. We said hello to each other and had a brief conversation. I could see that the dog he had on the leash was ill in some way, as opposed to the other healthy dog that was running free. We said goodbye and continued on our separate ways along the trail. A couple of days later, we ran into the same person at the same park but in a different section of the trail. I got to talk to her for a while about how her dog was going to have to have a tumor removed. It was so heartrending to witness an older dog and what getting ill and dying really entails. I was very touched by the whole situation, and I gave her dog a big hug since he was so adorable. After that we did not stay in touch with each other by phone or anything, but I promised to say hi the next time I ran into her there at the park. Sure enough we talked again just a couple of weeks later, and I saw the stitches and the bald spot from the surgery her dog underwent. He was doing well and was happy to meet my dog again, and the two of them ran around until eventually her other dog came back over as well. I felt personally touched by my direct experience with this poor dog, and I also felt good because I was able to contribute to his getting better by sharing some CBD dog treats with his owner.

We took turns running the registers, helping as many customer's as we could, and trying to get as much merchandise out of the store asap. The most difficult and tiresome part of all of this is dealing with the customer's. Their reactions to hearing about the store's closing ranged from disbelief, confusion, annoyance, anger, and panic. You would think that the world was ending by the way they responded to the news. We tried to explain to them as much as we understood ourselves (we all had little scripts to read to them, disclosing very little information), but they still pressed on wanting to know why. The most memorable experience I had was during the last week of the closing. The store was closed to customers, and we were putting things palettes and wrapping things up. The store was very empty, and we knew our time was winding down together. So we decided to all stop what we were doing, and stood in a circle and played catch with a tennis ball we found on the ground.

There was another day that we drove back into Destin, toured the city, watched the fisherman fillet huge fish and ate at Dewey Destin.

The show took place the middle of April. While at the show, we watched several extremely talented riders. There were several different disciplines including showmanship, roping, and reigning. In showmanship, the rider walked to horse out into the arena to be judged. While they are being judged, they are asked to do several different tasks. These tasks can be walking, running, backing up, or turning the horse. Whenever a rider is showing their horse, the stay on the opposite side of the judge, so they are not in the way. Roping is when you have the rider behind a locked gate. A person at another gate releases an animal, usually a calf. The rider rides in to throw a rope around the calf's neck. If the rider is successful, they are timed. The times are ranked. The person with the best time wins that round. Next, Reigning is when a rider comes in riding their horse. The horse and rider are challenged with several different tasks, many which consist of spinning. Spinning is making tight circles while going as fast as the rider can. At the end of their presentation, they often run the horse and have then slide into a sitting position. Reigning is a difficult class, but one that is especially fun to watch. If you ever have the chance to attend an American Quarter Horse Show, you will not regret it.",2.0,"I attended an American Quarter Horse show in April, 2019. The show was amazing.

I felt stagnant in Ohio, while at the same time I was interested in a woman I had met nearly 40 years ago when we both shared out first kiss when we were both 13.   I had a stroke 2 years ago, and was now retired. I found that I had no contact with my old friends anymore, and was hating the northern weather. At this same time I had been talking to my first kiss when I was quite young. She was/is very beautiful and very nice. I was shocked that she had been single for almost 12 years. It didn't sound like a horrible idea moving down to Daytona Beach Florida from Cleveland Ohio either. The weather would be perfect, the ocean was near, and the chance for romance spurned me on.   As good as I planned this trip from January to July, everything convinced me that this was a great move for me. I had a furnished mobile home awaiting me, the lady I was interested lived very near where I would me, and money would be plentiful for my happiness.   But, then everything that could've gone wrong did. I had 4 goodbye evenings planned to say goodbye to people I knew in Ohio. Practically noone showed up at any of them. I did manage to give some things to a couple friends that were very good momentos of my life. And I gave, sold, or left behind all my furniture as I was just moving myself and my 2 cats down to Florida in my car. Just some few momentos and my clothes were all I took. And then things got worse.........   When I got down to Florida, I found out that I'd been scammed by the person that said they had a mobile home for me to rent. THERE WAS NO FURNISHED HOME! Talk about being floored! I had to stay and pay for a motel room at first (that the landlord said she would cover.) After finding out about the scam, I booked myself into a cheaper (yet expensive) Airbnb while I tried to figure out where to stay. During all this, the woman I came down to see said she didn't want a romance, and that she just wanted a friendly platonic thing. (This after  talking to her for over 2 years over the phone.  Thanks to my sister lending me the money, I have now found a mobile home that I have bought with my sister's money. I have no furniture, and very little money to try and furnish it and to get by.",3.0,"Sometimes in life, you have an opportunity to try and change your mundane life.

I got up at 6 a.m. in the morning I drove from my home in Albany New York to the entrance to the trail. The trip is about 4 hours. I began the height and followed the various trail markers to The summit. Along the way I met quite a lot of people. most were younger than me but there were a few by age. Everyone was extremely friendly. It was a beautiful sunny day. I took the hike slow since it's a steady incline to The summit. I reach the summit after approximately two hours. It was beautiful.

Along the hike, we got some nice close up pictures of the fallen snow on the trees, and a few shots of some deer. At the main photo site, Dad planned to take shots of the massive ice sheets along the lakes. He taught me how to take different shots with his wide lens and then how to get closer shots with his zoom. In the end, I think we got about 2000 or so photos during the hike.

I told her that since the school day was almost over I would finish out the day and then I would head to the hospital afterwards if they were still there. I finished the day out at work and immediately left school to head to the hospital because my mom said that we all needed to be there as soon as possible to talk about some things. When I got to the hospital I was taken up to the ICU, which was strange to me for someone that seemed to only be suffering from the flu. When I walked into my dad's room I was terrified.

My mom had been crying I could tell, but  she didn't want to talk in front of my dad, so we all went in the hallway.

I was astounded because he never showed any signs of this before and was never told anything about this at doctor appointments. He was given 3 weeks to live. I was so scared and sad and I didn't know how to react, but only to believe that this couldn't be true. The next day my family and I spent the entire day hanging out with my dad in the hospital, although he was totally out of it by this point. I remember that day before we headed home for the night telling my dad that I would see him tomorrow and that I loved him very much. That would be the last time I ever saw my dad.

We rented a huge log cabin in the mountains that included pin ball machines, old school video games, a pool table, swimming pool, hot tub, and large enough areas that all of us could sit around and talk. This vacation was especially memorable because my parents who are in their 70's, were able to spend time with all 5 of their grandchildren, son-in-law, nephew, married in relatives, and myself, their oldest daughter. We spent a lot of time laughing and cooking together. We would sit out on the balcony and look at the breathtaking views. We were very high up on the mountain and the drive up was pretty scary at times, LOL, yet that provided us with a lot of pictures and memories that will last forever. There were a few times that we went into the city to shop, go out to eat, and explore what the Smokey Mountains had to offer. One evening we went to a new area where there is a huge farris wheel.

One day they brought back Trout. After they cleaned the fish my son-in-law put it on the grill and cooked it for anyone who wanted some. The first batch of fish was excellent and everyone ate it. By this time everyone was full. He still had one more fish that he had to cook. As I was eating this fish I noticed that it didn't entirely look done. I picked at it a few more times. That evening we all sat around the cabin talking and playing games. We had our telescope there so we were able to look at the stars at night and find the constellations.

She usually doesn't open up about her feelings that much, because she has difficult sharing them and being emotionally vulnerable. At a really emotionally vulnerable part of her life, I suppose it was harder to keep up the walls. She opened up about herself and how she'd been really feeling. It was so memorable because it meant a lot that she trusted me, and she admitted she really appreciated me as a friend. It's unlike her, but I knew she really meant it. We then had a deep talk about life in general, which was pretty moving in itself. I don't really talk to anyone about this kind of thing as well, so it was really pleasant being able to talk to someone about this kind of thing. She and I are actually pretty alike as people. We both tend to keep our emotions to ourselves, but we really seemed to connect that day. She said that her grandpa always gave her crap about dyeing her hair, but right before he died, he wanted to dye his hair green. She dyed his hair and he was happy about it.

This is the highest paved road in North America and sits just outside of Denver, Colorado. We took this excursion while we were on our first vacation without kids since our honeymoon; we have been married for just over 13 years. The event was emotional because the views on the way up the mountain were striking. You could see a number of other peaks across Colorado as you made the ascent and the landscape was beautiful. There were snow-covered mountain sides and a lake on the way up the mountain where you could get out and explore. We walked a number of trails. At times, the trails made me nervous as they were on the sides of high elevations and there weren't a lot of supports around. I was stressed at times that I was at risk of falling. The most memorable part of the trip was when we came across a herd of mountain goats near the top of the mountain. They would come right up to the side of the car and had no apprehension about the presence of humans. They were fun to observe, particularly the young goats in the herd, as they would frolic and play on the hillside. Though the event was memorable, it was also something that could be frustrating at times. It was crowded on the mountain that day. This wasn't unexpected, as the road is only safe to travel for roughly two to three months out of the year. But many people were driving in an unsafe manner. Some sped down the mountain. Others were not paying attention because they were distracted by the scenery. That added to the stress of the drive, which was somewhat nerve-wracking to begin with because the road was very narrow and didn't always feel safe. Arriving at the mountain top made it worth it though, as the view was breath taking. That said, it was hard to breath due to the high elevation at the summit, as the mountain is more than 14,000 feet up. I would do it again if given the chance. I even told my wife that it would be nice to take the kids to see the mountain and make the drive someday. It is an experience that I hope I never forget.",2.0,"When we saw the goats on the mountainside, all of the cars stopped in the road to get a closer look.

I can be that person who saves someone from going down the wrong path to handle grief. There have been a couple people who were here for me in that way.

She had a sick grandmother that needed care and we stayed with her and made our life out there. About 6 months ago her grandmother passed away and we both kind of realized that we didn't really like living there, but we also couldn't leave her grandma alone. So we decided to pack up our stuff in our car and a u-haul and drive back to the Pacific Northwest since both of our families are here and they were sort of asking us to come back. I remember very vividly our drive back across the country. I had this moment where I just felt free, like a huge weight had been lifted off both of us. Her grandmother was really nice and helped us so much when we were young and lost in life, to be fully clear. However, after nearly a decade of taking care of her it was a huge relief to just be free to worry about ourselves and focus on our lives and our relationship fully. That trip was maybe the best 2 weeks of my life. We took our time and saw the sights from coast to coast but the best part was definitely our time spent at the grand canyon. I always thought something like that was neat but pretty boring but seeing it for myself at that specific time in my life with the woman I love is something I'll never forget. We made it safely back home and now we're busy starting our lives with our families near us. I'd say we're in the best spot we've ever been in as far as our relationship is concerned.

I experienced a similar event.,"I can relate to this because while I wasn't admistted to a psychiatric ward, I did suffer depression about 25 years ago.  I had just broken up wtih my long-time boyfriend (who I was in a long-distance romance with for the last year of our relationship) and the breaking up was not of my doing. At that point in time, I was prepared to move back to his state (California) and we were to get married.  He decided he no longer wanted that even though he still loved me.  So, here I was, in the Midwest, just having quit my job and thinking, ""now what""?  I fell into a deep depression that was only quashed by some one-on-one therapy sessions (and after that didn't work), a visit to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with clinical depression.  At that time, anti-depressants weren't all that available but I was prescribed one and took it for 6 months.  A horrible situation in my life but I got better and moved on.  Although I moved on, when describing my inner self to a friend, I say that something in me died.  I'm fine; I laugh; I enjoy a good time with friends, but there's a part of me that died with that experience and I have never gotten it to come back to life.  I feel that I am an ""almost whole"" person but not quite complete as a result of that time in my life.  I don't wish it on anybody.  I can completely empathize with the summary above.  I know what it is like to experience depression.  It is a horrible place to be in, mentally.  But the good news is that there is help, even for those who fall into the deep pit of despair, as I did.  One of the worst parts for me was that I saw how it affected those around me.  I was staying with my Mom for a while during this time, and she would cry (in private but I knew that she was crying because of me.    It hurt her to her core that I was going through this.

For almost all her life, she stayed in the village, but she came to stay with us in the city only when we were in our teenage years as my parents who had to travel abroad because my father was an active duty British Army stationed in Hong Kong.  So those teenage years were the most precious years for me, something I more often remember.  It reminds me of how graceful my grandmother was. A village lady yet she was very disciplined, graceful and was an excellent guardian for me and my three sisters.  She was always careful enough to tend to us and put us in the first place and never complained about anything she wanted or she never got.  She taught us our family roots, the histories, the hardship of village life, her own hard life of having to get married in a young age and how she had to learn everything on her own.  She taught us about the important life lessons about Buddhism and to be humble, kind, truthful and the importance of family, the support.  She was a robust lady who never stepped foot in a hospital or taken any medication the whole life.  I still get the visual of her in her traditional attire, smiling back to us, her toothless smile and dimple on her cheeks.  But in life, there comes that unfortunate time in everyone's life that an accident happens and everything changes.  One sad rainy day, she simply was walking but somehow lost balance on a slippery road and fell and struck her head.  We rushed to her seeing her fall.  She got up and tried to convince her everything is okay, but we insisted her to go to a hospital for just a checkup.  We went to the hospital and did some x-rays and found out a hematoma was formed in her brain.  The first few days, she was alright but the following week, she started showing signs of forgetfulness and she started losing her memory.  Once back to the hospital, we found out, blood flooded in her brain and needed an immediate surgery.  She underwent that and once back, she was okay for a couple of days. Then again, she had the same symptoms.  Once again, we took her to the hospital and the doctor told us because of her age, she cannot be operated and told us to make her comfortable as long as she lives.  Two months after that incident, that morning, she said she was having a headache and felt tired and wanted to go to sleep.  That day, she slept like a baby and the next morning, when I went to wake her up for her morning tea, I said to her to wake up, but she didn't budge and when I touched her, she had passed away.  She passed away at the age of 86.  Even though I was sad, I was happy for her knowing that she no longer is in pain and now, wherever she is, I hope she is peace and hopefully looking at us.  She is in our hearts, that lovely robust village lady with a cheeky smile, hugging us from inside out.",2.0,"This is the memories of my strong grandmother that I have which I will be with me forever.

I got my husband back from a long deployment. This event was so memorable because of our son and how excited he was. It was also very emotional because we had been apart for so long.

He was supposed to come home a few days before but it got changed and it was so frustrating. His new time was going to be two in the morning and I remember being so exhausted. I woke my son up literally as I was walking out the door. He was such a trooper, while we waited for daddy he played with a little American flag and just crawled around. The second we seen him I started crying, and my son could not stop starring at him. I was so nervous about how our son was going to react to him. He was so young when he left and now almost a year old and had established fears. He was very nervous around men since he was not around many with his father being gone. But he went to his daddy like he knew exactly who he was and nothing made me happier than that moment.  We have been through deployments before but this was our first one with a child. This was a whole different experience that you could only understand if you have been through it. I am so thankful for my husband and everything he does for our family. Often when I think about him being gone and when he comes home I just think about myself and how I struggled and how I felt. I forget to think about him and how he is struggling.

I was the first person he thought of to invite to the concert, which I thought was very nice and sweet of him. The show was amazing, and it a great bonding experience for me and my friend. I felt much closer to him afterwards. It was a very positive emotional experience for me, because I got to experience it with a close friend and because I'm very passionate about music. Both of the bands put on a stellar show. The concert was about 3 hours long all together and we went out to eat afterwards. Overall, it was a great night. I'm so glad that I was the person they thought to invite. I'm very grateful for the experience as well as having a great friend like that.

Some people gathered sticks and small brush. Others got larger pieces of wood. I helped get a spot ready for the pit. I helped gather large rocks. We ended up making a large pit, as there were twelve of us altogether there, and we all wanted to be able to sit around the fire. We didn't make the fire that big that night as it was just more for enjoying the camping atmosphere, but the pit we made could easily be used for a bon fire. The next day we took a raft and went on the river. The raft was huge, and easily floated all of us down the river. It was fun, until the sky started to get dark. We got off the river and started heading back to the camp site. Sure enough a rain storm had moved in as we were on the river, and it started raining like crazy as we were walking back to the camp site.

There was a familiar knot I felt in my stomach like when I was high on a Roller Coaster, but it was only similar in that sense. Nothing and I mean NOTHING, compared to this feeling. I looked down through the window at what looked like boxes of corn fields and such and just realized that somewhere down there in those little tiny rows were my family. I was that small.

We started the night by stopping by one of our favorite restaurants and got vegan buffalo wings (the best in town, in my opinion) and a gigantic soft pretzel with mustard and beer cheese sauce. It was right before he was about to leave for an internship for the entire summer, so spending the night together was really intimate and fun, albeit quite bittersweet because I knew he would be leaving within two days. After talking about how much we loved each other over an amazing dinner, we got on the train and actually went to the concert. I distinctly remember looking over at him and watching him glow with joy at the show; I studied his smile and his eyes and was reminded just how much I loved him. ELO is one of my favorite bands and they were one of the best live performances I've ever seen. I sang at the top of my lungs and danced to some of my favorite songs, and my boyfriend and I held hands and smiled at one another during the slow songs. The lights were flashing all around me and it felt like I had been pulled from reality and inserted into a new world that was only dictated by feelings of euphoria and bliss. I also have a funny memory of buying a shirt, spending 20 minutes deliberating whether or not I should get another size, then running back downstairs during a break to switch it out for a smaller one (while my boyfriend begrudgingly followed behind me, but we laugh about it). My favorite part was discovering new songs that have become some of my favorites today, like ""Xanadu."" I had no idea I would fall in love with so much more of their music! Listening to it live for the first time felt like magic was pulsing into my soul. I am often moved by music but this experience was truly something else. The entire night I felt nothing but happiness, like I was right where I was supposed to be - I wasn't worrying about being separated for the summer or starting summer classes. All I cared about was experiencing what it feels like to be in love in one of my favorite settings: an incredible concert. We waited a long time for the train to take us home afterwards, listening to our new favorite ELO songs on my phone while I sat in his lap. When we got back, we stayed up late to have snacks and spend some quality time together for the last time in a long while. It's one of the most memorable nights I've had with him and something I'll carry in my heart for a long time, especially because it also involves one of my favorite musical acts.",1.0,"My boyfriend and I went to dinner and then a concert by one of our favorite artists, Electric Light Orchestra.

The actual writing of the article had been exhausting (even more so because I was (and am) in the middle of a rather intensive diet which had a tendency to make me light headed at times) and required an immense amount of reading on my part. This was all made worthwhile by selling the piece and getting the positive reaction, however. In the end the experience left me mentally drained for a long time afterwards (writing around 100 pages while also working 48 hour weeks and dieting was pretty intense).

I always have been her favorite I think. Its funny because I never apprecaited that until I had kids. Its so important to bond with people. I just want to help with her and make things better.

I called an Uber to take me to the UPS store so I could mail the packages I wouldn't be taking on the flight. Then I took a second Uber downtown to the train station. I would then take a train to the airport. I arrived about 3-4 hours early so that I'd have time to get past TSA and grab some food and try my best to relax.

It all started six months prior when I saw a family friend that I hadn't seen in awhile.  As soon as I saw him, my heart started pounding.  My stomach dropped to the floor and, of course, I had to pee right away.  All of the bad memories assaulted my mind in a matter of seconds.

So we started watching videos on YouTube. We wanted to keep it a surprise so we tried to come up with a clever way to find out what he likes. So we had him watch the videos with us of different places we could go to. My initial idea was a theme park but on one hand he was still a bit too young to ride most of the rides. Regardless we played him videos of theme parks that are available in Florida. In the middle of us watching a random ad popped up. It turned out it was a video for Chuck E Cheese. He was really excited watching that video so we had our idea. On the day of his birthday after opening some presents we all got into the car. He had absolutely no idea where we were going. We brought his tablet so he had some of his shows to watch because the drive was a little far. When we got there he was so exited! Seeing his face light up was so worth it. Thinking back on this today I feel like we made the right choice. We can do theme parks when he is a bit older. We ended up with some great pictures as well. He passed out right away when we were finished. It really was an awesome birthday for him.,1.0,My wife and I had trouble coming up with a cool place to take our son for his birthday.

Granted, it's the Sunday 11am-7pm shift, but it was mine and mine alone. It's great being acknowledge with a promotion and responsibility after years of neglect and downright disrespect. See, I was kicked out of a university professor job simply because the dean of the school did not like me in any way. He said that my student reviews were ""far below average"" even though they weren't, and he refused to provide the average. He said my ratings from the first semester did not get better at all, citing a single solitary number from an odd class that wasn't in my area of knowledge, and was more than a year old. I couldn't fight back because he is known for retaliation and my wife had the same job in the same school, and I don't want to screw her over. So, I had to get a retail job. I worked at a home improvement store and within four months, was sabotaged out of the department despite video evidence supporting me that magically supported them. I am 100% certain they kicked me out because I'm not a redneck like them and didn't fit in. So, I was put in a 5am-9am job six days a week for a year with no paid time off, no vacation, no benefits of any kind. Obviously, this was crap so I sought out a promotion by doing all the in-home training and in-store work that I could, but was denied it over and over.

I went to get a fresh bowl of popcorn made and it was delicious. It was warm and buttery. After we finished watching the movie I thought that it was alright and decent. My mother liked it a little more than I did surprisingly. I felt that there was a bit little too much focus on human characters that weren't necessarily all that interesting in my opinion. The final fight was alright, but it needed a bit more focus on the monsters, there isn't much human characters can do and also a lot of the humor was awkward and fell flat.

I stood there shocked thinking well dont you think you should want forgiveness from me too. But of course I got nothing not even a sorry . So no she will not be able to see my kids.

In fact, they spent the past year and a half helping my fiance in preparing what they knew would be my dream proposal. My fiance, Alex, started  our day by ordering us room service for breakfast. My mother told him I loved homemade french toast with strawberries so that is what we got. After breakfast Alex took me to the shopping mall and told me to pick out a nice gown for the evening. At this point I admit, I was a tad bit suspicious but I was still clueless that all of my dreams were about to come true.  After shopping, Alex took me to get my nails done. By this point it was 4pm and I was really starting to wonder what he was up to.  When we arrived home he suggested I get ready for dinner. When I got out of the shower he was gone. But there were rose pedals and lit candles leading up to a note and flowers.  The note had an address on it, so I quickly but carefully got dressed and did my makeup. I rushed down to the parking lot and headed to the address Alex had given me. Upon arrival I noticed there were no cars in sight. I entered the  building and was immediately escorted by a kind gentleman over to Alex. We spent the entire night laughing and joking and just all out enjoying ourselves. After  we ate he finally popped the question.  Then my entire family came from the back of the restaurant to photograph us and cry with us. I still cannot believe he flew my family all the way out to Tennessee just for our proposal. And I cant believe my family had been helping him this whole time! I am truly blessed.

I even looked through books for a different way to do the ends, i did not want fringe on the ends. So, I found an old book and found a very interesting way of tying knots to finish the ends. There was a comment on the paper that came with my ribbon, strengths and weaknesses of my project. They were not enthuisatic about my ends, but I am fine with the way I choose. It is extremely different and was difficult to learn, which increased my self esteem and was more encouraging.

Things were strained for a period that felt long where we didn't talk or hang out as much and you could just tell that we were not as close as we had been in the past. There were times where we would actually yell at each other and get in this big blow up fights. Our relationship felt much more competitive and cut throat than it was before which was strange. Then a while back I got a wedding invitation in the mail which started the events that would change things back to the way things were. The way things were when things were good and we really felt like best friends. I think I mentioned before that I would still text him when I was back in town but we didn't always hang out or if we did it still felt weird. For whatever reason things were way different this time when we were hanging out the night before his wedding. We talked about things like we used to and there was an openness that reminded me of the past. We stayed up really late and both felt really happy, we didn't need to hash out everything that happened before because we had talked about it a lot. It was a lot of fun and then we got to hang out a few more times after that during the time after the wedding/reception. From the time past that point we communicate a lot more which I think continues to help. I really make it a point to do that because there were some long period in the past where we would kind of ""ghost"" each other.

He wasn't as excited to eat anymore, he had trouble walking, he completely lost his eyesight. It was hard, watching him go through that. I didn't know if I should be the one to put him down, or hope that maybe he would pass peacefully in his sleep one night. As time went on, I could really see him begin to go downhill. I woke up one morning and found blood in his crate, knowing something was wrong I took him to the vet. They couldn't see any cuts on him, and explained that he may be bleeding from his anus. I asked if maybe he ate something sharp, and they said it was possible but to watch him and see if he continues to do it. So I watched him, and he bled every time he went to go potty. He began to throw up after every time he ate, he didn't know where he was half the time. At one point I picked him up and he bit me, not because I had hurt him, but because he was starting to lose his mind. We knew it was time to put him down, and I hysterics.

How could I stand there for one second and him be there with me, and the next he's gone.

That night and the following morning I considered canceling the appointment, but hours before we were supposed to go in it looked like he had a seizure. I held him the entire time to make sure he didn't hurt himself, and once he was done I made him comfortable until it was time. We brought him in, and they drugged him so he was out of it. I didn't leave his side the entire time, I wasn't going to leave him alone. He had been there for me my entire life, so I was going to be there for him.

She felt it was time to create the next public conference where people could meet the most well known crystal skull teaches and investigators in the world and I said it sounded like a good idea. I have personally been invited to speak at various crystal skull conferences over the years as well as have helped to organize a few of these. Thus, my friend decided to create such a conference near Chicago and invited me to be one of the speakers.  This conference will take place later this current month.

However, it is in my nature to offer to help create such a conference as there are keys aspects  I have learned about how to incorporate in such an event that could enhance the experience of the attendees.

Over the months as the conference was being announced publicly I would offer to help and share it with others we know via emails and social media but in my heart, I knew this event would miss some key activities to really share about the crystal skulls.

This was truly an amazing experience as not only is the tower lit with lights in the evening, but also at the beginning of every hour, even more lights begin to flash on the tower, giving it a bright, sparkling glow. After our time in Paris, my girlfriend and I, along with my friends, flew to London. I spent the final three days of my vacation sightseeing in London. I had a chance to ride the London Eye and look at Big Ben (which was unfortunately under renovations). I really enjoyed the food that I was able to try in London.

Then they told me they were quitting their job and moving across the country to live with their ex and the ex's parents until they could find work. The last time I spoke to them was about three weeks ago when they were packing. Again, we had a very tense short conversation and then that was it. So, I googled what was going on between us and I found this thing called 'parent abandonment'. Just reading the words was like a punch in the gut. How could this be happening? Apparently it's something of a trend with the younger crowd. I read a few articles about it and then I decided I knew all I ever wanted to know about this. The best advice was from a women who had four children walk away from her at different points in their lives. And this brave soul said, ""Go out and live a full life because you did not abandon your children."" I'm working on that part now and I might even move.",5.0,A distant relationship with my only child seemed to improve somewhat during a tumultuous break-up with their romantic partner.

I tried to put the spare on but the lug nuts were not coming off.  I was in the middle of nowhere, on the highway, with all of my worldly possessions, pets, and girl and completely stuck.  Well, Craig drove on out probably 150 miles or more, and helped us get going again.  That's the first time I met the man! After living in Georgia for awhile I soon learned that it was NOT anything like California.  Church is big around here.  BIG.  So I got involved with the Church, through Craig, and we started helping put roofs on the houses of widows.  Tough work for sure, but it was extremely rewarding.  I learned so much for the other men helping.  After Craig passed the entire community rallied together.  It was sad of course but amazing.

This was his first visit home after enlisting in the Army. I was so excited to see him and I was so relieved when he was finally sitting beside me in the truck for the drive home. I was so filled with pride when I saw my son in his Army uniform standing in the airport. He looked so grown up, more so than one would expect after just the passing of several months. I can tell just by how he stands straighter and taller, with his shoulders back and his chin held high, that he is proud of himself too. Starting in the truck on the ride home, I was so full of questions and so eager to hear about my son's experiences. I needed reassurance, as a mom, that my son was doing all right and that the Army was treating him well and fairly. Seeing my son looking fit and happy did a lot to give me this reassurance and to dispel the worries that I had been feeling after hearing of problems my son had been having with certain people during Basic Training. At one point, it looked uncertain he would even successfully complete the training. But now, seeing him, I knew everything would be okay. As my son shared his stories, he could laugh about some of those experiences with the perspective gained by the passing of time. Now, he was collecting his own stories, and I'm sure there would be more to come. I could laugh as well, instead of feeling the ache of wanting to protect my son from pain, emotional and physical. Seeing my son now gave me such hope for his future. It made me feel like everything would be okay, and helped balance the worries and headaches my son had given me as a rather troubled kid, drifting without any concrete goal in mind, after high school.",1.0,My memory is of the first trip home from the Army that I spent with my son.

His condition was not improving, so we thought the trip would be a great way for all of us to bond with him at least one last time. The actual trip itself was fantastic. I had never been on a cruise before, and although I was slightly nervous given the way the media portrays cruises (i.e. Titanic), once I got on board I had forgotten all about that. The boat was huge and beautiful and there were friendly faces where ever you went. There were musical performances every night, and so many activities every day to do, from quiz shows based on disney properties, to learning how to fold towels into animals. There was even a theater on the ship, where I saw Coco for the first time (which I definitely teared up over). But the best thing was the food. There were a lot of restaurants, each with their own theme. Between buffets in the morning and five star meals in the evening, I was never hungry. My grandfather was with us for most of the activities, but there was one instance that gave us quite a scare. As I was moving around the ship with my sister, I received a message from my uncle telling me to come to his cabin immediately. Apparently my grandfather was really not doing well. When we got to the cabin the rest of the family was surrounding him as he laid still on the bed. There was a look of concern on everyone's face. My mom was trying to get him to eat a banana earlier, but he had stopped eating. As we were all looking at him worriedly, he suddenly jumped up and bit the banana that was in my mom's hand. We were all startled, but when his mouth curled into a smile, we all started laughing.

We had been to Paris before, but we were still very excited. We booked cheap flights that had a lot of stops and one of them was in Spain. Once we were in the Spanish airport, about 10 minutes before our gate was going to be announced, we received an email saying that our flight was cancelled. We didn't know it at the moment, but the gate we needed to go to in Paris was having some kind of unknown issue and a few flights were cancelled. Nobody at the airline seemed to know what was going on, and after hours of waiting in lines, talking to airline employees and pulling our hair out, we were herded onto a bus that was headed to Barcelona. It was about an 8 hour bus ride. We arrived at the Barcelona airport around midnight, but our bus driver had never been told what to do with us once we got there. We did about 5 laps around the airport while the driver waited for an answer from somebody, anybody. He eventually dropped us off at a terminal, drove off and left us there. Once again, no one at the airport knew what was going on and it took hours to get everything situated. We ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport, behind a customer service booth.

I was the only one working on it despite the fact that they added additional grade levels to the event. It had originally just been fifth and sixth grade, but this most recent year they added third and fourth grade in as well. This made it more challenging because being younger, they are obviously at a different stage of development than fifth and sixth graders. Organizing academic events, including engineering-related and computer science-related events that would work across all grade levels added to the challenge. Plus, I was organizing it all by myself. So I had to come up with the list of events, buy and organize all of the supplies, create and write all the directions, and organize all the teams across grade levels in a balanced fashion. The latter was probably the most challenging part because I don't know all of the grade levels, and so I don't know the kids very well, and their teachers weren't overly helpful at providing information about them.

However, it all ran much better than I expected.

My wife, 2 daughters and I traveled from coastal San Diego to the Palomar Mountain area where we camped outdoors for several nights in April of 2019.  While it was Spring time, the elevation of the campsite atop the mountain made for a very cold camping experience.  We arrived on the first afternoon to the campsite.  We were one of a total of 4 families camping at a campsite that could accommodate 50 campers, so that should have been our first clue that we might have picked a bad time to go camping.  We were very organized in that all of our camping gear was packed  well in our car such that we were easily able to extract things like the tent first.  After we had the tent erected, we placed the air mattresses inside of it and prepared the sleeping bags, and organized our clothing.  Once all of that was set-up, I decided to take a nap in the car (since I was still fighting off a lingering head cold) so my wife took our daughters to go for a short hike.  About at hour later my wife returned and we began to make preparations for dinner by setting up the fire.  While I had no experience camping, by wife had a reasonable amount of experience, so she was able to get the fire going without too much difficulty.  However, as we were warming dinner and the sun began to set, the temperature began to plummet.  My daughters and I began throwing on more and more layers of clothing in order to keep ourselves warm.  My wife, who was hovering over the fire while tending to the food, was not overly cold but she was stunned at how chilly it was getting so quickly.  I sat by the fire, eagerly awaiting dinner, with my two daughters crammed onto my lap as I sat in one of our folding camping chairs.  We ate dinner and the girls happily made smoores afterwards, but that didn't last long as the temperatures dipped into the 30's!  We put out the fire and retired to our tent in order to get some sleep.  We rearranged all of the sleeping bags and air mattresses so that we had 2 people in each one: myself and my smallest daughter in one, and my wife and older daughter in the other.  I was wearing 3 sweatshirts and had 2 extra blankets over me, but that was just barely enough to keep me from shivering all night long.  When the sun arose, we quickly started another fire, but quickly ran through the remainder of our firewood just to keep from shivering constantly all morning long.  After the sun was fully up, we were able to hike and bird watch, then enjoy a filling lunch.  However, as the sun began to drop in the sky the second day, the temperatures plunged too much.  We opted to take down the tent, re-pack the car, and head home so that we wouldn't have to endure another frigid (by San Diego standards) night on the mountain.

In the morning my mother sat me down and told me what happened. He passed away while my grandmother was trying to help him out of bed. He was coughing up blood and she told him ""Taya, your bleeding,"" and he looked her in the eyes, then closed his eyes and never woke up again. The day he died was one of the worst days of my life. He was the only father figure that I ever had in my life. On the day he died President Trump was visiting the city that I live in. A few days before a white nationalist came into my city and murdered over twenty people. My husband was on the way to that Wal-Mart but turned around when he saw many police cars and a police helicopter in the area. If he had left an hour beforehand he would have been part of that awful scene. I was still trying to process that tragedy and what had happened the day my grandfather died.     We had to navigate standstill traffic all morning and afternoon on the seventh while trying to get things settled at the funeral home and cemetery.  This was all due to that asshole Trump showing up here even though he was not wanted. In between talking to funeral directors and planning a memorial we watched Trump roll his fat body around our town on the T.V. At one point during the day we wanted to just go and eat some food together and talk as a family, but that took several hours because we had to wait for Chester Cheetos's motorcade to pass us on the freeway. In my life I had never felt such a strong dislike for another person as I did for that stupid man who came and made the day my grandfather died so much more terrible.  I could only imagine what the people who lost people in the shooting just days before were feeling. Many of them were planning to bury their loved ones on the same day we were. My grandfather died of old age, and it was expected. Those families lost both young and old, in the most unexpected and horrific way possible. I still think about that week all the time.",3.0,My grandfather died on the same day President Trump came in to get television coverage after a tragedy in my town and it was awful.,60.0

I turned my 20 dollars into 50, I was very content with quitting there, and just watching my parents play slot machines.

So that is what we decided to do. After we talked to our other kids we decided that adoption would be the route to go and then the process started.

Foraging for food in the landscape around me is a real thing and I can do it. I started thinking about the plants around me when I saw a foraging video on YouTube. A teacher was showing students about all of the edible plants in a park that happens to be near my house. I was interested in the video as I have alot of experience with gardening and it dawned upon me that I could do this too. I started looking up plants online and watching other videos about plant identification. I started slowly by looking for one single type of plant and trying to identify it multiple times. After I was confident that I could identify the plant, I ate a couple of leaves just to test out the effects of it. I would wait a day and when nothing happened negative, I became more confident in my id's. I ate more the next time and continued to find out as much as I could about the plants habitat and features. Immersing myself in one plant at a time has been a great way to expand my knowledge. Now I can identify many plants in my area. I know the leaves, fruits, colors and features of a number of edible plants. This has given me a food source other than buying food from the grocery.

I was behind on bills as it was and I was counting on overtime for the next couple of months to catch up on what I had missed. In actuality I had spent more than I could afford on that vacation to Aruba but it was just something I had to do for my family. When your friends tell you that they are taking their whole families on a trip to Aruba and they want you to come, you don't pass that up. Those are memories that could last a lifetime. Anyway, I was trying to catch up on those bills and going through a ton of stress at work that carried over to home, I just couldn't help it. It was only a matter of time before it started to truly affect my work performance, I just didn't think it would happen so quickly. Juggling all my account while keeping the bosses happy was something that I was always able to do with minimal effort, I just think the amount of stress made me handle situations in ways I would never do and act in ways I should never act. It started when one of my biggest accounts called asking for follow up information on details regarding their last purchase. I just snapped, I told them they'd get it when they always got it and if it wasn't good enough then they should take their business elsewhere. Well they took that business elsewhere, right to my bosses and over my head. When my immediate supervisor confronted me about, I admittedly got defensive and told him to shove it, in so many words. Not my best decision. So that was 2 weeks ago. Since then everything had been going just fine, I applied myself harder than ever to make up for my bad decisions and told myself if I outworked everyone, everything would be okay. Well, when my second biggest account called asking to compare prices and look for ways to cut costs and my answer didn't suffice, that was the last straw. Since I had fixed all my mistakes and took care of everything I needed to, I felt like I hadn't done anything wrong. So when my boss came into my office with news that I had been let go it caught me off guard. I was not given a formal warning of any kind. I was shocked to be learning I wouldn't be getting severance pay and they would not even give me 2 weeks notice. I had a great run here at the company and I accomplished more than I ever thought I would. It's just so upsetting to see it end in this way. I'm ready for my next challenge.

I have always known that I have an older brother from a marriage that my Dad had before my Mother.  I had found my oldest brother on Facebook years ago and tried to reach out to him then. Unfortunately, at that time, he was uninterested in knowing me or my brothers. Recently though, about 3 months ago, my brother reached out to my Mom and let her know that if my brothers or I wanted to contact him, we could. I ended up messaging him on Facebook and have been talking to him ever since. It's strange how very similar we are and how much we look alike as well. This contact with my estranged brother has brought about MANY emotions that I never knew that I had. Our father passed away in 2014 and talking to my brother has in some ways resurfaced my grief. I've also felt joy, happiness and a feeling of connection with him that I never knew that I could. Also, we ended up getting in touch with each other around the five year anniversary of Dads death and that felt like a punch in the gut. It was my Father who chose not to have contact with my brother and in a lot of ways, I feel terrible for him.

I yelled at her, and reached for my own gun, and the cowardly spawn of liberals drove off because they don't fight with people who are able to defend themselves.

Yeah, the kids were doing well and we were better off financially than we had been in a long time, but I was super unhappy with the state of my marriage. My husband had just started a new job, and while I know it was stressful and that I should give him some time to adjust, I just couldn’t stand the cold way that he was treating me. It felt like when he got home, he would hide away and play on his phone or lay on the couch watching TV – he never really made an attempt to engage with either me or the kids. I let it go for a long time, I made excuses for him, I started to blame myself – what was I doing wrong that was pushing him away? Finally, after months of living with a virtual stranger, I couldn’t take it anymore and I blew up. I said a lot of hurtful things, including bringing up and comparing him to his own deadbeat dad. He said a lot of hurtful things too, about my weight gain and diminishing sex drive. I honestly thought that we were irreconcilable and started doing the research for divorce. I even confided in my dad, just in case I would be forced to take the kids and move in with him. It was a dark time, but hindsight shows me that it was a necessary time. The fighting was cathartic and we were able to get down to the root of our issues and start over. It’s been a rocky road, but I know it was worth it because life has gotten so much better.

We tried to make our parents understand our point of view but you know how South Asian families are when it comes to caste and religion. Only thing Oshan and I knew that very day back in April was that we were going to get married that month and we were going to go ahead with our plans no matter what obstacles we would have to face. See, Asian families have this idea of who a perfect partner for your child is. The thing they don't understand is that they want their child to marry a stranger just because they like that person, not even considering the opinion or the choice of their own child. Our case was similar. He was tall and I was short, I was a bit on the chubby side and I wore glasses. The only issue his family had with me was that I was fat, ugly and a christian. Too bad they didn't realize that I was a warrior. There was this one time when his father actually told my father that I was fat, and my father responded saying, ""I feed my children well and unlike your kids mine aren't malnourished.""! My parents were supportive of our marriage and relationship unlike his parents. Getting back to April, we decided we would get married after witnessing our families fight with each other regarding our relationship for nearly 2 years. On the 28th we went ahead as planned, at my house. Just like that we got married! No big wedding, just us and a few close friends and a good BBQ! I still remember the tiny little details just like yesterday. I was excited and so was he. He got me flowers in the morning to decorate and they were white and yellow. The skies were a bit dark and all of us were worried that it might rain in the evening, and it sure did! He came over with his friends in the pouring rain and was wearing a light grey suit.

It can be described as a big drop of water that falls on your umbrella and you feel the vibration of it in the handle. Then my water broke. It was nothing like I imagined. And so the task of a long labor began. Twelve hours plus later, when my strength was running thin the medical team arrived to help deliver the baby. I was eagerly anticipating seeing her and holding her in my arms for the first time. You hear the cry and you look at the red baby that the doctor holds in his hands, and then the nurse takes the baby and brings it on your chest. That moment when the baby first lays on your chest is magic. You go from hearing a crying baby to quiet time. And I say quiet because, besides the fact that baby stopped crying, I honestly did not hear anything else that happened around me afterwards. Looking at the baby girl was all I was able to do. Awed, amazed, and thankful for such a blessing! Brown fine hair covered her little head, she had her eyes open and her head turned towards me, her skin was pink and wrinkled, and looked soft, she had all ten fingers and toes and that felt ridiculously reassuring, even though I already knew that the newborn was physically healthy. The nurse dried her and wrapped her loosely in a newborn blanket. I was then able to hold her for the first time. She had her little fingers in her mouth and was quietly looking up at my face, somewhat expectant. I looked in the dark blue eyes of my little angel and tears of joy filled my eyes. It felt euphoric and unreal to hold my own baby in my arms. She was light and fragile, she felt warm, and she looked so content.

Easy enough for families with young children, the 1.3-mile trail parallels Rim Drive, offering several tantalizing views of the lake with virtually no elevation gain. Want more? Continue on to the fire lookout at Watchman Peak, which, at 8,013 feet, is one of the highest points in the park. After the steep climb, enjoy the payoff: an unparalleled view of Wizard Island in its bowl of blue. You’re in for a treat, because you planned ahead—way ahead—and booked a room in the Crater Lake Lodge. Originally completed in 1915, this classic example of “Parkitecture” was almost lost. The building was failing under the heavy snow loads each winter, and it took a huge public outcry—and great expense—to prevent its razing. Though much of the lodge was re-built entirely, the design remains true to and even improves upon the original vision, with larger guest rooms and updated amenities. Step into a different century and enter the splendid dining room, with its unpeeled tree trunk columns, exposed wood ceilings, large windows and muscular stonework. Or, if the weather cooperates, sit on the veranda and sip Chardonnay while contemplating the view. e experience is made even lovelier with Northwest fare such as sweet corn fritters, field green salad with Oregonzola cheese, and balsamic-glazed lamb chops. If day one was all about the views, today is about getting up close and personal with an open-air boat tour of the lake.

My wife's aunt was able to come with, using her scooter, so it was nice spending our day with her also. She had only been to the lower portion of the park, so we were determined to get her to the top-most visitor's center in the park. After an hour and a half or so, we finally made it. We were able to buy some souvenirs and eat a nice lunch with my wife's cousin and aunt. It was a great lunch, and was the closest I had been to nature in a long, long time. After the long drive back, my wife, daughter, and I went white water rafting! None of us had done anything like that before, so it was quite exciting. My daughter and I sat in the front of the raft, with my wife sitting behind my daughter. No sooner had we left the shore, my wife fell in! She was ""rescued"" but soured for the rest of the ride. We kept her spirits up and we powered through nice category IV and category V rapids! She made it the rest of the way and although she was a trooper after having fallen in, she vowed never, ever, to do anything even close to resembling that again. After we finished, we were bused back to our start point, drove back to my wife's cousin's house and went to bed after a very long, exhausting, yet fulfilling day.",2.0,"We spent a vacation day visiting Rocky Mountain National Park.

But we do get together with friends because we like them so much. Our friends are avid campers and invited us to go with them over the weekend in the middle of summer. Of course we accepted and we looked at each other when we got home and wondered what supplies we might need. We had no idea what to bring nor what to expect. So we did the best we could considering we didn't even have sleeping bags much less a tent. We arrived at the campsite where our friends were already. The place was serene and had a good atmosphere but the heat was unbearablly hot. There was no place to hide from the heat. We didn't move much during the day at all and hoping that the sun would go down quicker than usual. We took short hikes around the campground just to see what type of facilities were there. Not much in the form of relief from the heat. Well the sun finally went down and then we had to deal with the mosquitoes. I hate mosquitoes. Fortunately we did bring insect repellant and our friends saw that we were a bit frustrated about the whole thing. Our friends started a bonfire and that was wonderful. That took away the mosquitoes and was warming the coolness of the night. We drank beer and told stories of our past and then had a good time from that point on. I am glad it lasted only two days because I just am not cut out to be a big time camper like my friends. Me and my wife were surprised at the empathy that our friends took on us. I felt that they had been in the same position when they first started out camping as well. Me and my wife learned a lot about ourselves and our friends during that lost weekend of our lives.

I had never met the woman, but I've so many stories that I feel like I did.  This past July, her family and I flew out to the Big Island in Hawaii to spread the ashes.  The day came to spread the ashes and we made the picturesque drive across the Island to the Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden.  I have never seen such breathtaking sights in my entire life: lush, verdant, practically alien-to-me plants everywhere; the most colorful flowers you can imagine; awe-inspiring waterfalls; and a medley of countless exotic birds all singing their enchanting island songs.  Once we arrived to the gardens and began the descent down the trail, it was even more sublime than the drive.  I truly felt like I was transported to another reality in which nothing existed but this sprawling, magical rain forest.  I was nervous that the day was going to be difficult for my girlfriend, her sister and all their children, but I approached it with a level of confidence in my abilities to comfort that I didn't even know existed.  We gathered at a stopping point and everyone said words that celebrated the life that had been lost.  The plan for everyone to find spots in the gardens that spoke to them and spread portions of the ashes.  The remains were divvied up and we resumed our journey downward. The atmosphere grew quiet and the birds almost seemed to sense this:  their songs had quieted into barely audible chirps.  Everyone's faces had a mixture of sorrow and happiness and I just maintained a stoic, yet positive look throughout.  The silence was interrupted by my girlfriend's oldest daughter who shrieked as she sprinkled some of the ashes, ""Ewwwww bones!""  My stomach sank for a moment, but everyone else chuckled a little bit and we moved on. The group slowly began to separate a little bit and my girlfriend led me down a path as she clutched my hand.  ""Find a place that you'd like to spread some,"" she said.  I panicked for a moment and said, ""I don't think that's appropri---.""  She cut me off with a firm shush.  ""She would have loved you.  Please do this for me,"" my girlfriend said as tears were welling up in her eyes.  I quickly, albeit a bit reluctantly, agreed. A few moments later we came to a majestic, spindly tree reaching higher than all the others around it.  A solitary bright beam of sunlight was gleaming through the canopy above and had illuminated an orchid.  The orchid was a beautiful mixture of purple fading into pink with little flecks of periwinkle on all the petals and it was swaying ever-so-slightly from a breeze; I knew this was the place. As I sprinkled the ash just underneath the orchid onto the moss-covered ground, the birds stopped singing entirely and I was enraptured by a tender, touching silence like I had never experienced in my life.",1.0,"I went to Hawaii with my girlfriend and her family to spread her mother's ashes.

This has been something my husband and I have both been looking forward to. He's 21 and still relies on our support for an extensive number of things. I know that this was harder on my husband than on myself. However, I think it's an absolute crucial step in him learning some independence and growing up. For the majority of his life, he's not been responsible. This move was on his own accord though, which I think is important if it's a situation that he'll continue to stick through. He and his girlfriend didn't enlist our help at all in moving his stuff out of our house, or into their new apartment. I was quite surprised by this, but excited at the prospect of him taking on the situation. Thus far it has been enjoyable having our own space to ourselves, without an irresponsible adult ""child"" living here with us. I hope that he will maintain the living situation for himself, including saving his paychecks to cover his own rent and bills. Thus far it appears that this is the case. On the day he moved out, my husband and I actually had plans to have come some company over for dinner. We didn't know that they had secured the apartment yet, nor did we know that he'd be moved out so quickly. While I was actually quite relieved to finally have him packed up and out of the house (something I've been pushing to have happen for over a year now, my husband was more emotional about the whole process. Mostly its been a smooth transition, however, he still feels like he has a room in our home and readily shows up whenever he wants. This happens most frequently at dinnertime, which is frustrating.

I suppose we could have just driven to the concert on the day of the concert, but it's just so much more fun to go together and take the shuttle once we're there. Anyway, we made the caravan and got to the hotel about 9 p.m. on Friday, and had rooms across the hall and next door to each other. We had pizza and stayed up and watched movies and room hopped.

It was very helpful for my child to select ones they are interested in and would pursue their studies in the future. It is is very important to touch these necessary information early prior to their application deadlines. We drove to a few cities nearby where the universities we are interested in located. We visited 2 schools each day during this trip. We first visited a few schools on the east coast, then visited others on the southwest side. A few Ivy leagues schools were included into this trip. According to the well known rule, we divided these schools into three categories, reach, match, and safe to schedule our visit concentrations. For a reach school, we focused on to learn more about the admission policy. For a match or safe school, we concentrated on the required documents including SAT test scores. During the visit, we figured out which major could be more promising one when applying for a reach school, considering as a premed track student later on. For a match or safe school, we strictly followed up the most interested major such as Biomedical engineering in one engineering school. We compared the similar ranks of schools in terms of student population size, campus life, major strength, faculty to student ratio etc. We finally narrowed down to 10 schools in our list. One of things need to mentioned especially here: be sure to check in on time prior to your information session. For example, WashU treated a campus visiting as the demonstrated interesting of a student on them. Some of schools followed up us after our campus visiting.

She is not my mom but I love her for who she is all the same. In the past few months my mother-in-law has been quite ill. In the last month, I learned that she has stage 2 borderline stage 3 lung cancer involving a large mass in the lung. I saw her last week for the first time since her diagnosis when she stopped to spend a night with us while on her to begin cancer treatment. She was in good spirits despite the long journey. She joked about death and mentioned doing her 'dying person' prayers. Being a feminist and an incredibly open-minded person, she was extremely supportive towards me and my unconventional career choices, encouraging me. Everything felt suspended in disbelief and she was filled with more tenderness than usual. In a way this surprised me because she has many reasons to be angry: with her doctors or with life in general for striking her with cancer, in addition to many other misfortunes. She was relaxed and calm and put on a good face but she also looked frail and had lost a significant amount of weight. The next morning she got up early and when we said goodbye to her, she seemed so small and impotent and alone.

I had just started a new job, so I had to sell a majority of my belongings and dip into my saving to pay for representation. In the process, given I had to take time off from my new job, I wound up being let go even though I was told by my supervisor that it was okay for me to take time off from work so soon given the importance of the situation. I knew I wouldn't be able to keep up with my overly expensive rent, so I wound up breaking my lease early and living in an Airbnb for a month thanks to my savings. This gave me time to look for a new job and actually apartment to start over in. I wound up losing the custody battle in the process because I could not longer afford to pay my attorney. If it wasn't for the vast majority of online jobs available today and the fact that I didn't sell one of my laptop computers, I probably would've been out on the street considering everyone in my family has passed, and a majority of my close friends now live on the other side of or outside the country. Needless to say this has been an eye opening experiencing, and it just goes to show you that life is so unpredictable. Here I was comfortable in my careen path only to have an unforeseeable event turn entire life upside down. I've always been a humble person, but when you go from eating at five-star restaurants daily, to eating free Dunkin' Donuts for a month straight it really makes you realize what's really important in life. All and all this experience has taught me a lot. Not to be jaded, but to really cherish and be thankful for the little things that you do have (like your health) instead of taking things like a hot shower or clean water for granted. I honestly don't know where this journey will take me next, but I'm honestly thankful that I at least have a roof over my head while I fight to get my life back to what it was.

So, I went ahead and hired her. She was to help with design and project manage the remodel. Her contractors came over to measure etc, and I received the quote, which ended up being $10,000 PLUS the cost of all the new appliances/fixtures. i was a little frustrated as she knew my total budget was $10,000 but the new estimate would be around $14,000. I cut a few costs where possible, but we went ahead with it. I had told her the sort of countertop i wanted, but when it came time to select the countertop, the ones I wanted were double what i had initially been quoted, therefore I had to compromise and go for a cheaper countertop.

It was the summer that I felt I would know my place in life. I've always felt like I had a good grip on the games education, work, and in my personal life.  Holiday parties are usually boring and mundane but I knew this would be different because of the expanded invitation list.  It was my 5th wedding anniversary and was also a combination party for the 4th of July.  The list included family, neighbors and many of my old friends who happened to be in the area this time of year. I thought it would be great to reconnect with many old acquaintances and friends and catch up with them and reminisce about old times and what's been going on with their lives.  I have been a good been a good pen pal (old school) with many of them so I kind of understand where they are at in their life.

The pavilion tent was set up and the catering was in place.  The chairs and tables were set up picnic style and everyone took their place.  This was by far the biggest party I've ever thrown.  Conversations were amazing, the details were vivid and the stories of the past just kept rolling off like a waterfall.  It was at this time I realized that the things that I thought were important Lake success at work and amount of money that I had in the bank were just a part of my life, they shouldn't have been the focus like I always made them.  Seeing the families and how close they were made realize how lucky I really was as a dad and hey, I had the extra time and effort to do the same.  I'd always been self-serving and self-centered but I was just playing the part of the leader of the family. I guess I really didn't understand what that meant to all the others around me until one of my best friends told me that his daughter was suffering from an advanced form of cancer. He spent every waking moment with her hand put everything else on his life on hold.  It was at that time I realized that if that ever happened to me, I'm not mentally equipped and I would have to find that type of determination in my soul which I currently don't have.  It was at that time I felt that I was no longer just the most important person in the world.  Being a father is much more than just being a someone who supports the family with material needs.   I would have to fundamentally change everything about me. I knew there was a reason I was looking forward to this day.

Not one car but two, the 98 Ford Mustang the later matching my last name of the Ford expedition. AN tour with an Army unit the first time buyer cost jumped out the roof. My unknown phenomenon was credited to my version of street racing. When Ford Motor all but eliminated passenger cars from its North American lineup earlier this month to concentrate on trucks and S.U.V.s, it turned the page on a long and storied history of now-defunct but once red-hot nameplates: the Model T, the Model A, the Galaxie, the Fairlane, the Thunderbird and the Falcon, to name several. There was one conspicuous survivor: the Mustang.“Get rid of the Mustang?” asked James D. Farley Jr., Ford’s president of global markets, when I asked him this week how the Mustang had survived. “The Mustang is like Rocky: It survived the 1970s fuel crisis, the glam 1980s, the move to S.U.V.s. It’s made it through every round of cuts.”For me, the Mustang’s reprieve came as welcome news: I took my driver’s test in my mother’s 1967 turquoise Mustang notchback. On the rare occasions I was allowed to drive it, it conferred instant status and triggered unabashed envy among my high school classmates. Wall Street probably would have been just as happy to see the Mustang go the way of the Fusion, Taurus and Fiesta, current models that Ford said it would phase out and which Mr. Farley dismissed as “commodity silhouettes.” (Ford says it will continue to make passenger vehicles, but they just won’t be in the shape of today’s sedan. The Focus, for example, will survive, but as a crossover S.U.V.)That’s because in its last earnings report, Ford revealed for the first time that a relatively small number of products, including the hugely popular F-150 pickup truck series, accounted for 150 percent of its earnings before interest and taxes, with profit margins in the midteens. Another group was barely profitable. By contrast, Ford said its “low performing” products lost money, with negative margins of more than 10 percent.",5.0,"Around the time of this, there were very few external changes made to the Mustang. The interior was also very similar, though the clock was integrated into the stereo system, which is an easy way to tell the difference between the 1997 and 1998 Mustang.",780.0

Some people talk to you in an old-time manner, and you feel like you are talking to an old shop keeper of the time period.  The hotels in the area are designed like casino themes much like the time period that they were probably casinos.  There is a lot of memorabilia to buy.   An actor in the play we saw had given us a free deputy badge to cherish. it took a long time for us to travel there by car.  We drove about 15 hours to get there.  It was well worth the wait though. It was unlike anything I have ever done before, and I would recommend anyone do it who is a history buff from that time period.",2.0,I went to South Dakota to visit various landmarks and it turns out people there still celebrate celebrities there that have been dead for 200 years.

She was a lovely woman and everyone who knew her, even people outside our family absolutely loved her. She was, however, very secretive about her health and didn't want everyone to be concerned about her dying. When she did pass, it was a big deal for our family. We had spent almost every holiday at her house, eating delicious foods at her table. She always went all out when it came to the family, and everyone always go the best she could offer. My family was really upset that I didn't go to the funeral. At the time I was only a teenager and had never attended a funeral. I was grieving but also really terrified to see her in that way. I was scared that that would be the last time I saw her. I thought about all the times that we had shared together and it was overwhelming and unbearable for me. My family just could not find the sympathy to understand how I felt and acted as though I didn't care about her passing, when that was the furthest from the truth. The only person who really understood was my father. He really got how frightening it could be for a child to have to see their grandmother's body before they put her in the ground. He told me not to worry about the rest of my family's opinion and that it would eventually blow over. I still am really thankful for him understanding how I felt.",1.0,"My grandmother died.

I've had this session for a while (it was a gift) but it took me almost 3 years post-death to scrape up the courage to actually do it. I was skeptical, absolutely—I do believe in spirits and that our energy has to go somewhere after death, but that's a far leap to actually communicating with a dead person. So, going into it, I was honestly more scared that it was going to work than that it wouldn't. The first few questions he asked me were basic—said that he was seeing a father figure and asked me if a grandfather of mine had died. Being my age, it's fairly reasonable to assume that at least one of my grandfathers are dead (both are) and as I wasn't particularly close to mine, as he was talking about him, I was starting to write the psychic off as a phony. However, then he asked me if there was someone specific I wanted to contact, and of course, there was; I asked him to bring my friend forward by repeating her name multiple times. Immediately, things felt different. He started pulling out details about her death that were 100% accurate, and while I was definitely getting closer to believing him, I still wondered if he had researched my social media in depth or taken the time to do a deep search on people in my life. But as we went on, he started recalling things that there were absolutely no way he could have known. He pulled memories out, he described the streets I walk on on my way to work (where apparently, my friend walks alongside me sometimes). He talked about her parents, about how she feels now that she's in a different place, and asked about our other mutual friends. At this point, I was pretty convinced (and emotional, of course). It wasn't until he pulled out a very specific detail—something that had only taken place in a private setting after my friend had already died—that I absolutely lost it and started sobbing; I knew it was real. I was somewhat in shock; I was essentially communicating with someone that I was sure I would never have the chance to again. The session was only 45 minutes long, and I wish I could have had longer, but it provided me with a sense of closure that I hadn't felt in years. It made me sad, for sure, but it also made me happier, and it felt like I was relieving a burden. It was one of the things that have affected me most in my recent life.",2.0,"After a close friend of mine died, I was gifted a session with a medium. After 3 years, I finally scheduled it, skeptically, thinking that it would be a waste of time.

Seeing nothing and returning to my room, I saw that the area right next to my bed was on fire because my phone or laptop had overheated and exploded next to my bed.

Our bodies are wonderfully designed with complex pathways designed to eliminate toxins. As apart of my self-learning, I began to research the supplement, alpha-lipoic acid. Convinced that this supplement could be beneficial, I began taking this common supplement. If one believes the hype, one could expect miraculous improvements in one's health if detoxification is impaired.  Upon taking the supplement, I noticed unexpected physical responses that were not in line with improvement in health. This caused me to dig deeper into this supplement. In the process, I came across the knowledgeable scientist from Quicksilver Scientific, Dr. Christopher Shade. It was during one of his presentations that I learned how the body can have blocks in detoxification as a result of exposure to toxic mold. This surprising fact caused a light bulb to go off in my mind. I had personal experience with toxic mold exposure, and this fact led me to believe that my unexpectedly lackluster response to alpha-lipoic acid may be due to a mold-induced block in my own detoxification system. Thankfully, there are good strategies for dealing with this sort of block in detoxification, and products designed carefully and comprehensively to assist in maximizing activation and functioning on the detoxification system. I encourage any reader to explore the Quicksilver Scientific range of detox products, and especially the Push Catch System, as well as to take advantage of the available teaching resources and seminars presentations available online from Dr. Christopher Shade.",2.0,"This story highlights my personal journey in discovery of the body''s innate detoxification processes, and how to overcome blocks to detoxification.",150.0

The local commissioners were there for the celebration and the shelter chief was there for the celebration.  Refreshments were served and shelter souvenirs were available to give to selected participants in the celebration.  Many of the old volunteers were at the celebration and we all were so excited.    The playground looked great and the turf is so much better for the dogs to go out and play.  They don't have to have a bath now after playing on the playground.  The installation of the new turf was part of some revitalization of the shelter to show the community that the new management was serious about helping the shelter environment.    I walked around and met several old friends that had been a part of the shelter.  It was a very good day to see this finally installed for the dogs.  It was a great day for talking about the future of the shelter with more improvments to come.  The community came together for this project.,1.0,New green truf was installed on the playground at the animal shelter.

I had broken one of my molars while I was asleep, and the pain was so bad it was radiating through my jaw. To make it worse, it was the weekend, so there were no dentist's offices open near me. The pain only got worse through the day until I was curled up in a ball with my eyes squeezed shut. I finally found some Aleve and took it, which relieved the pain enough that I was able to think straight. Still, I couldn't manage to do much that day, I couldn't bear to eat, and I couldn't sleep that night. The next morning, I went to the dentist as soon as they opened and asked if they could fit me in. I didn't expect much - perhaps some painkillers until I could make an appointment - but they were shockingly nice and understanding, and the receptionist had me sign in for an emergency appointment right away. The dentist examined me, said I would need a root canal and a crown, and offered to fit me in that morning. I was amazed at their willingness and ability to fit me in, especially after the last dentist I had been to where I was always waiting for an hour at minimum and treated more like a problem than a patient, so I jumped at the chance. I paid for the root canal, he numbed me, and I spent the next two hours getting the gentlest and most careful dental care I'd ever gotten in my life. The discomfort was minimal, the dentist and the hygienist helping him were friendly and frequently making sure I was alright, and the procedure went smoothly without delay, even though I was a last-minute patient. I was so stunned at how nice and conscientious they were without sacrificing efficiency in their work. I'd never been to a dentist like that before, and I'd honestly been dreading going to a dentist because I was waiting to be scolded or shamed for my tooth problems like previous dentists had done to me. Between their kind treatment, the horrible pain being gone, and how tired and loopy I was from not eating or sleeping, I was almost in tears thanking them when they were done. I made an appointment to get fitted for my crown and walked out feeling relieved and uplifted, which was the last thing I expected to feel after a root canal. It was obviously expensive, but it was worth every penny.",1.0,"I woke up with a painful broken tooth one morning and had to wait a day to go to the dentist. When I did, I had to get a root canal.

I got it after the $1000 clunker I bought in high school died on me.  Having a mechanic glance at it would have cost more than it was worth. I went around looking for a newish used car, but I had bad credit from some delinquent bills from college.  Most places wouldn't finance a car without a HUGE down payment.  I was just out of college and had no money and only an entry-level job.  Billy Bob's Used Cars said that they would finance anyone.  The cars in Billy Bobs had the monthly payments stickered onto their windshields.  The prices were less than I'd seen elsewhere.  I was really stressed out about the whole situation.  I was stupid and I rushed through the whole process and didn't carefully read the sales contract.  In the fine print was a little mention of this thing called a ""balloon payment.""  At the end of the loan, i was expected to pay a lump sum of $1200.  That was why the payments were so reasonable. I contacted the Better Business Bureau and the state Department of Consumer Affairs, but they both said that, while rare, car financing with a balloon payment was legal.  Just because the dealership failed to mention the final payment verbally doesn't mean that there's anything actionable in the agreement because there it was in writing.  I think the dealer and other dealers take advantage of the fact that some people just want to get the odious process over and done with as quickly as possible.  It is just an embarrassing episode that I don't like to talk about. I have better credit now, so my bank kindly gave me a loan on the equity of my now 6 year old car.

It was the 1930's and they were young and poor. My grandfather couldn't afford to purchase a wedding ring for my grandmother. She didn't much care about a ring but my grandfather desired to give her one. Many years later,  my grandfather opened a jewelry store in a Fitzgerald, Georgia.

She chose a modest round cut diamond solitaire and a matching diamond fishtail band. She was very fond of the rings and would only wear them on special occasions that required formal attire.

She was beautiful and smart. She was also very witty and friendly as well. After about 2 months of chatting, we were official. She decided she wanted to move to my state and live with me.

I knew vague details of our family history, such as Great grandpa LeBrun marrying a native american woman from the Kalapuya tribe in Oregon and settling down on the Willamette river area, but there were a lot of details that were either never shared with me or forgotten. My younger sister got  a subscription to an ancestry website and the three of us started digging and telling stories. I learned that my Great great grandfather was part of a group that voted for the area that is now Washington State to become part of Canada. I also learned that my great grandfather was a tax collector that raised horses. Among all of these stories I learned that my great grandmother lost nine of her eleven children to diphtheria. The only reason my grandmother and her twin survived is because they were kept in the snow outside and warm bricks were wrapped up and changed 24 hrs a day.  My grandfather, her father, inherited a huge sum of money from his tax collecting father. At one time he owned 500 acres of Willamette Valley bottom land, (which now grows incredible wine grapes) He was the first in his family to graduate HS but couldnʻt get a job because he was half native american so he started drinking heavily. This led him to be missing or in jail for large portions of time, leaving my mom and her mother vulnerable to threats from the local KKK. She told me about being followed home as a child, how they would threaten to burn her house down. She was so sad when she told me about how they couldnʻt even afford a proper lock on the front door. I wanted to learn more but I didnʻt want to press the sadder issues until she felt ready to share. Along with the sad times there were a few moments of levity. I learned that even though my great grandmas side of the family were native americans they were also very tall!

She was there for 18 days. I stayed with here the entire time, she was contagious so I could not leave. It was during this time that I had what I think of as an awakening. There was not much to do and I knew that I had to do something to keep myself strong. I started to exercise. Gradually I began to move.

I took the train (because I'm not a big fan of flying) from Chicago to Denver which took about 20 hours. It was by far the longest I've ever spent on a train, and I was super happy to finally get off in Denver, but the ride wasn't so bad. It's way more comfortable than flying because the seats are bigger, with lots of legroom and you can get up to walk around. They even have an observation car with giant windows, although it was usually crowded. Nobody was sitting next to me, so I had tons of room. And there was free wi-fi, so I watched Netflix and did all the normal things on my computer that I would have done if I was at home. All in all it was a pleasant ride. When I got to Denver, I had a few hours to kill before I could check into my hotel room. So I decided I would walk the 5 miles from the train station to the hotel. There just happened to be a nice bike/walking path along a creek that covered most of the distance. It wasn't in a hurry and it was a hot day, so I took my time. I saw lots of breaks to sit and watch the cyclists and joggers pass by. When I finally got to the hotel, I was pretty sweaty and red in the face, and I still had a little more time to kill. So I found a bathroom and freshened up and relaxed in the lounge for a bit. Then I checked in and went to my room. From a quick internet search I saw that there were about 5 dispensaries all within walking distance from my hotel and I could see 3 of them from my room. So I picked the one that had the best reputation and went to buy legal cannabis for the first time. When you first walk into the dispensary, it looks like a boring waiting room. You give your ID to someone and then they buzz you into the main room where everything is for sale. Then you assigned a ""budtender"" who helps you choose what you want to buy. I had no idea what I wanted, so that was helpful. I ended up buying some edibles, which I tried that night. It was my very first experience with cannabis and I slept like a happy baby.",2.0,I took a train from Chicago to Denver because I wanted to try cannabis for the first time.

The bleeding got so bad that they had to give him a suction hose to keep it cleared out. He got to where he could not breath at all and his oxygen was turned up as high as it would go.

It’s often difficult, and sometimes it can even seem impossible, but in the long run, it’s more than worth it. When you need a favor, a landlord who likes you (like a trusted family member) can be a real lifesaver. Of course, that doesn’t mean you have to bake them cookies or mow their lawn. Just pay your rent on time, let them know immediately if you ever need a little more time to gather the money, and don’t make a habit of paying late. Beyond that, just make sure you know your landlord-tenant rights both locally and nationally, and your relationship should be easy-going and mutually beneficial. No matter where you live, specific rights apply to all tenant-landlord relationships, regardless of whether they’re spelled out in or omitted from your particular lease agreement. These include but are not limited to the right to receive police assistance in emergency situations free of charge, the right not to cover a landlord’s legal fees in the event of a dispute that ends up in court, and the prohibition of landlords from discriminating against prospective tenants on the grounds that they have children. Similarly, the law dictates that all tenants have a certain set of responsibilities inherent to their rental agreements. For instance, tenants are required to pay their rent in full on the day outlined in their lease. Tenants must use amenities like parking .lots and laundry rooms responsibly and without causing harm or destruction to them. Tenants are obligated to dispose of all waste materials such as car batteries, motor oil, and electronics in a safe and proper manner. It was a surprise encounter at just the right moment. It was good timing since I hadn't talked to my neighbor in a while before this. In addition, some states, counties, cities, and municipalities have laws and statutes in place that expressly prohibit tenants from participating in gang activity, physical assault, or the sale/purchase of illegal substances. Unlawfully using a firearm on the premises is another hard no. you feel like your rights have been violated, contact your local tenants’ rights organization for assistance. In the event that they agree that your rights may have been violated or that the landlord’s demands are illegal, seek legal assistance to determine your options. Ignoring disputes usually only escalates the problem and creates bad blood between you and your landlord .a situation that can seriously tarnish your peaceful home life. I have been in My apt I month and I have no hot water for three weeks what do I need to do. And everyday I call they tell me it will be on today. That doesn't work I tried and they told me to do the counxiling and they kept giving me a different number",5.0,I was re-doing my kitchen my neighbor had a free stove that he let me have.

The event was a Family Fishing derby being held for family and family friends at one of my aunt's fishing stock ponds near her house. It was a potluck type event, but there was plenty of good food to be had like hotdogs, burgers, and macaroni salad. I ate a lot more than I anticipated and gave myself a bit of a stomachache but I still don't regret it either because I enjoyed it all. Along with the fishing contest there were other activities like frog catching with nets, with prizes for catching the biggest frog or fish. After that was the annual picture with all the kids and young adults who hadn't reached thirty yet, I was in that photo too. Then after we did that we watched the littler kids all participate in the frog race, where on a sheet they would race the captured frogs to win other prizes. I didn't participate in the games because I had already outgrown the age range of the kids participating. It was fun just watching the kids and teens have fun though, and I got to eat more while I watched. I indulged myself in dessert and talking to some of the family members I didn't usually get many chances to see casually. Also I nearly had a frog jump on me during the frog race for the kids. While I like frogs, I don't like slimy feels so I jumped back a bit when the kids were releasing all the caught frogs back into the pond. At the end of the event we all got commemorative coins for the event that my aunt had specially prepared for the occasion and I was happy to get one.

I talked with them about the possibility of doing parking on their lots as well, with the option of splitting the proceeds 50/50 between them and me. It was surprising how beneficial the Garth Brooks concert ended up being because I made more money than I planned on making, and then that also gave me confidence to sell parking for a graduation ceremony a few weeks after the concert. After that, I sold parking for football games in the months that followed, and I coordinated with the neighbors I had talked to on Garth Brooks concert day, so that we were able to offer parking for the whole block on football games. Having the whole block available meant having approximately 30 parking spots to sell.  The football games attract large crowds and the ticket prices range from $50 to $100 depending on the game, so I was able to charge a relatively large amount for the parking spots for the football games. I was able to earn a nice amount of money that I then put into my savings.  Being able to ""live off the land"" by selling parking has helped me feel entrepreneurial while also helping to reduce stress by giving me a safety cushion of savings. I also found myself being responsible and helpful to the customers that were parking.  I learned that customers might have many questions about the event that they were attending.  I tried to prepare beforehand by reading details about gate opening times and other event-related details, so that I could answer questions questions might have when they were parking for the event. I have been pleasantly surprised because I made far more money than I anticipated making, no one had any problems with their cars, and my neighbors were able to make a good amount of money by entering into the 50/50 agreement with me, so the whole block of residents has enjoyed added happiness in recent months as a result of me first doing parking fo the Garth Brooks concert 8-and-a-half months ago. I also got to enjoy the good feeling of being able to offer tailgate chances for the football fans who wanted to park at the game very early before game time. The tailgate parties that developed on my parking lots remained safe and I made sure to patrol the areas regularly. I wanted to make sure the vehicles were not threatened, the people were not misbehaving, and the area was maintained in a clean manner during the event.  Overall this economic experiment of doing parking for the Garth Brooks concert ended up being a great idea, and I look forward to more parking chances in the months ahead.",1.0,I sold parking in my front yard for a Garth Brooks concert that was happening across the street.

Not much in the way of close relationships and not a whole lot of random acts of kindness have come my way.  That's whatever.  It doesn't bother me and I don't expect stuff like that to happen so I typically don't feel the lack.  About six months ago I started a friendship with someone in an internet forum where groups on people that primarily work online sort of gather to discuss things during the day.  We've talked frequently and even though we don't work together so to speak it has many of the qualities of a work friendship.  Anyone that knows me knows how I feel about my dog.  I'm quick with the pictures and he get's a fair amount of mentions in my day to day conversation.  My boy is terribly allergic to fleas and they've been very bad this year.  I've been fighting to get them under control and for the most part it hasn't gone well so my dog has been miserable. It bothers me. A lot.  Point being that I've discussed the flea problem and solicited possible solutions that I may not have tried yet within this group of people.  I haven't gotten much in the way of feedback because I've tried everything there is to try.  You're probably wondering where I'm going with this and I'm getting to it I promise.  A few Saturdays ago I took the dog for a nice long walk around the neighborhood relatively early in the day. It was gorgeous out. Bright and sunny.  That was nice but it really highlighted how bad off my poor pup was doing and I was feeling pretty crappy about the whole thing when we came back around to our street and headed down the driveway.  When I got to the door to go into the house I saw an Amazon box sitting in front of the door.  It had my name on it so I brought it inside and opened it.  Inside was one Xtra Large Seresto Flea Control Collar and 1 container of freeze dried liver treats.  She took it upon herself to order a flea control solution and a container of treats so my boy would feel better.  It was the nicest thing anyone had done for me in quite some time. I was touched.,1.0,I received an unexpected and very thoughtful gift from a long distance friend of mine.

I was driving home and I noticed an old dog trying to cross the road. The dog was clearly old by the way it moved and it was not even wearing a collar. I got worried about it's safety so I jumped out and got a collar and leash and i had in my trunk. The dog seemed friendly enough but they were clearly scared of me and I didn't want to put it in more danger so I kind of shepherded it towards the side of the road. From there I was able to approach the dog and get close enough to put a collar and leash on it. Ok so where do I go from here I thought to myself as the dog had no collar or tags, and it was slightly past 9:30 at night. Thankfully my house was close by so I walked the dog into my garage and gave it some dog treats and water as it looked exhausted. This gave me some time to figure out what I would do next. I ended up making a big sign that I could post on the  street corner nearby thinking that its owners would be out looking for it. After the dog was refreshed a bit from some food and water I got a new idea. Since I couldn't call animal control at that time of night, I was left with a few options. Keep the dog for the night and call for it to be picked up in the morning. Or put the leash back on the dog and see if it would try to walk its way home. I chose the latter so off we went in the dark following the road until we got a few blocks away from where I lived. At this point the dog was trying to turn off of the road into some very dark paths and I was hesitant to go off the beaten path with my new friend.

Who knows the next time this movie would be in a theater again. As I got to my seat, the theater was empty. Perfect. I was all set with my popcorn and soda and ready as ever. I forgot how long it had been since I had seen this movie. The film was enhanced and restored to have picture perfect quality fit for movies today. The thrill and mystery I remembered from this movie was bigger and better than ever on the big screen.

Dinner at the BBQ place was super fun and I was most surprised to see a soju tower on the house when I showed up. It was a huge tower-like container that has a switch and when you open it, soju just comes flowing out. The price of it was more than $30 so I was really surprised to see the restaurant just gave it to us on the house. I was also surprised by how many people showed up. I hadn't checked who else was coming and I was pleasantly surprised to see some friends I hadn't seen in a while. This dinner was significant to me because my friend was turning 21, an age that is pretty important to a lot of teens. It wasn't as important to me, but it was to my friend because she is quite a heavy drinker, so that made it important to me too. I had a really good time during the dinner. I was anxious at first because I wasn't sure where I would be sitting. Since my friend invited a lot of people I knew it was pretty guaranteed I wouldn't be able to sit with her.

The trip wasn't too far and the traffic wasn't bad either, we made pretty good time. The weather was nice for the entirety of the trip, mid 80's and sunny, nothing to complain about. The children's museum was quite interesting and had a ton of interactive things for the kids to mess around with. They looked to be having fun and were running from exhibit to exhibit to see everything the museum had to offer. After they had seen everything there we stopped at the cafe inside to grab some lunch before heading out of the museum and over to the zoo which was conveniently located nearby. The zoo was pretty big so we knew it would take up the remainder of the day, luckily it was only noon so we had plenty of time to see everything. We looked over the map of the zoo to see what we wanted to check out first, the kids wanted to see the large safari animals like the elephants and tigers so that's where we headed first. There was a vehicle you could board that would give you a drive by tour of the animals so we hopped on. We saw elephants, lions, zebras, giraffes and several other animals which the kids liked. They were pointing and trying to take some pictures with their phones. One of the elephants came extremely close to the vehicle and the children couldn't believe what they were seeing. To everyone's surprise, the elephant let out a loud sound that scared everyone, but the tour guide assured us that it was completely normal and to not be afraid. The children were laughing after it happened. After the ride we got off and walked around the rest of the zoo until my cousins' feet began hurting and we decided to call it a day. It was getting dark by then anyways and we left to go find a place for dinner. All in all it was a very good day that everyone enjoyed.

Nursing care is not offered, nor does this kind of facility have legal authority to give skilled nursing care. If a nurse is on staff, the nurse's role is limited to assessment and directing the resident assistants. Some assisted living facilities also have a separate nursing home wing or section, and that requires a different license to be a skilled nursing facility. If there is an emergency, no one will not offer emergency care. It is difficult to care for, or needs frequent treatment for chronic conditions, the assisted living facility may not accept them. A doctor has to verify that they are suitable by signing a form. On top of that, the facility does its own assessment to see if the prospective resident is a fit for their community. No one is watching over your loved one 24/7. Help is available, but your aging parent will not have a personal attendant noting their every move. Someone will check on them daily and if they don't show up for meals, someone will notice. If medications are being given out by the attendant (""med tech"") every day or more than once a day, that person will notice if something is wrong. They help with basics but should not be expected to diagnose, or offer anything other than exactly the medications on the resident's list. They may ask the nurse to check on a resident. These homes offer an enriched social environment. There are meals in common and a chance to socialize, activities offered, and entertainment of various kinds. Some communities offer classes. Residents have a way to call someone if there is a problem. If they're not feeling well, an assistant can be summoned by either pulling a cord, a call bell, or pressing a button. The proximity of attention to an aging parent's needs is one of the best ways to assuage the worries of adult children. The actual cost of assisted living may not be fully understood when you size up a place under consideration. You may be quoted the price for the rent of the apartment. The cost is usually more than the rent, as your loved one must also pay many other charges. If help is needed with bathing, for example, there is an additional cost for that.Mom can't remember to take her pills?

When I told my father he was surprised asking me every few days, ""you're not scared?"" I honestly wasn't, I guess at the time I was more concerned about having enough money to last me during the schooling phase.

I had studied and earned my CLP (commercial learner's permit) while I did the odd jobs to get the money I needed for the trip.

The first maneuver was actually pretty simple, just drive forward and back up.  Well it SOUNDS simple but it really isn't; the back of that 53 foot trailer wants to go in directions you didn't give it permission to go in. You had to learn to control the trailer and make sure it stays straight and doesn't continue to offtrack right or left. Eventually I got it down even though I genuinely felt I wasn't going to be able to do it. Then came the next maneuver which was offset parking. Take your trailer and move it to the very next spot. This took some time but eventually I got it after again thinking I wouldn't be able to do it. Then the next maneuver, parallel parking. Just thinking about parallel parking a truck still frazzles me to this day, but eventually I nailed it in five minutes, or so I thought. After practicing all three maneuvers till I got sick of them came test day. In my first station I had nailed all three maneuvers after much practice perfectly. In the last practice station I had trouble with parallel but ended up doing a prefect parallel right before I tested. Because my results had been inconsistent I wasn't exactly sure how I would test but long story short I ended up failing the parallel my first try during the test. I felt so defeated and extremely sad but I wasn't going to let it stop me considering I hated the thought of going back home with mom and dad.

We took tons of photos and sadly the video camera didn't record anything, even though we thought it was recording - apparently there was some defect in it. Regardless, my dad keeps talking about places we've been and things we've seen and he's keep referring back to the photos (he even print some of them on canvas to hang in his house).You see, my dad lives overseas so this trip was more than just bonding experience, it was first time I have to see him for a very very long time.

We LOVE camping but there was something extra special about this trip- well, two things actually. The first one being that my brother was leaving a couple days later to move back to California for work. The second thing is that my uncle was going to come meet us at camp and stay for the day. I am from a small town in California called Paradise, that was decimated by wildfire last year. My uncle moved to Washington after the fire and I moved to Idaho ( I was not living in Paradise at the time of the fire though so thankfully I didn't lose my home or anything like that). Anyway, like I said my uncle was going to meet us at camp. I was so incredibly excited for this because I had not seen him in about 11 years! When we got to camp I did not have cell phone service so I was unsure as to whether or not he would actually make it (camp was a 1 and a half hour drive from his home). I was so excited to see him walking up that I nearly started to cry. I ran to him, barefoot through the woods, and gave him the biggest hug ever! There are no words to accurately describe that moment. It's like gaining a family member back in your life that you thought was gone forever. We hadn't seen each other in that long because I had moved to Reno, Nevada about 8 years prior and we just sort of lost touch over the years. My uncle is someone who I have always looked up to so seeing him was extra special. We sat by the lake, enjoyed lunch, and caught up on all the time we had missed. I am so very excited to have my uncle back in my life. While it was bittersweet because at the same time as that visit, I realized I was saying goodbye to my brother (he is now in California nearly 14 hours away from me in North Idaho), it was so fulfilling to see my uncle. You just never know where life will take you and who can unexpectedly come back into your life when you aren't anticipating it. I miss my brother since he moved, but I have my uncle back.

I was able to negotiate the whole deal before and get approved for a loan before I even got to the dealership.

She starts her senior year this year and has had somehow found the perfect balance of partying and studying.  She has maintained an ""A"" average and can party harder than I ever could.  Very proud of her.  I think somehow my nephew feels that he could never measure up to his older sister but nobody expected him to.  She is a freak of nature and we only wanted him to do what he was capable of.  So when my brother called to tell me that he had been kicked out of school and could not graduate with his class, my heart broke.  I went through that spell when I was in high school as did my brother but we both pulled it together in the end.  I had given up hope in seeing him graduate but at the very last minute, they called and told him that since he had finished all of his online studies, he could walk across the stage with his class.  I immediately started crying when he walked out, ever so casually.  He looked up into the stands and gave me a wave and that beautiful smile of his.  My heart beamed with pride as I sat and waited for his name to be called.  3 months later and he has not really changed.  I am still hopeful that he will come to his senses and find his way in life.  I had a son when I was 18 years old and had given him up for adoption.  My nephew was born 6 years later and I think this is the main reason that I have always felt so close to him.  And the main reason why my heart breaks when he does stupid stuff that he knows he should not do.  Still, I have hope that like the rest of us, he will wake up and realize that he can do better and will go on to lead a successful and productive life.",1.0,My nephew had been kicked out of school during his senior year and we were told  he would not be able to walk across stage with his class.

I'm 24 now, and as I grew up, my family usually went on some type of trip each year, whether a smaller one for the weekend or a week-long vacation. This one was different though, both because it was my first vacation since moving out on my own as an adult, and because it's the first one I've gone on since my parents divorced. I grew up with my Stepdad, I don't remember a time before he was my acting father, and so it was just very strange to be going on a vacation without him. My brother didn't go either, so it was just a bit of a shock overall, I suppose. Everything was so different and I didn't expect to be so emotional, but I couldn't stop myself from thinking about how everything just felt wrong, lonely almost. From the activities we now couldn't afford to do on just my mom's salary (she wouldn't let me help pay), to how I just didn't have my brother to sit and talk to once the parents went to bed. He's close to my age, and we always used to have sort of a mini-vacation of our own on these trips, bonding in a way we never did at home. My mom, sister and I had a good time, maybe even a more relaxing one without the boys complaining, but I couldn't keep my mind off of how it just seems lately like my family fell apart. I know my parents never wanted that, but it's been a rough couple of years. I barely speak to my dad now, and sometimes it's just a painful reminder that I guess he never really was technically my dad. I spent a lot of time laying on the beach cabana, letting the sun warm my face while I just took it all in. I feel different since coming back, like maybe I developed a new understanding for things, maybe got a bit of peace about the situation. But I can't help but feel sad when I think about how my little sister is growing up in essentially a different family than me; she won't remember much of us all being together and happy. She'll have memories of going  back and forth to mom's house and dad's, and I hope she just finds stability in that somehow the way I'm struggling to find it in this situation, even as an adult.",4.0,"I went to the beach with my mom and sister, our first vacation since the parents divorced.

I wanted to travel and spend more time with my family. I wanted time for myself. My company was having a big retirement party for me. They laid out a big spread of food and there was a delicious retirement cake. My company gave me a watch to thank me for my 25 years of service.

The biggest surprise of all, was that all the employees chipped in and paid for a trip to Italy for my husband and I. They were really sending me off in style! I could not believe it.

He was being given is his sheriff's badge and officially accepted into the sheriff's department. We had to go to the courthouse area really early and at 7 am we were led into the compound of buildings and into a secured area. The sheriff came and gave a speech before pining a badge on each one of the new sheriff's shirts. I used my phone to film the whole process. I also looked around while they were talking and I saw very interesting photos of sheriffs going back to the 1800's. There were also photos of many sheriffs on the wall of the facility who had died. It was emotional when the sheriff spoke because he talked about how family was the real reason that they did what they do and it was clear that he meant it. The most surprising moment was when they were told that training started right away. I expecting to get to spend the day with my brother since we even had family in town and it happened to me my birthday but he had to stay and we had to leave. The event was still significant to me and I was glad I got to witness it because it's not something I've probably have the opportunity to do again. I also think it was important for me to be there to support him. I think it makes a difference when you have family who support your career choice. I also have considered law enforcement in the past but I've always decided against it.

We arrived at the cabin and were amazed at how nice it was. Spacious ground floor and a loft with beds upstairs that overlooks the cabin. Once we unloaded everything and mom left to get groceries, my dad said he had one more thing to show us. We went out the back of the cabin that faces the lake. There was a small shed off to the side. He took out some keys and fiddled with the lock before opening up the door. There were inter tubes and a jet ski inside that we were allowed to use. My brother and I took turns on riding the jet ski. He would drive and I would ride shot gun and then we would take turns. The lake was beautiful. My dad got a bunch of pictures of us while he stood on the dock and watched.

I was shocked, and walked over to them to see if I could calm things down. Judy looked at me and said, "" And you...you are the cause of all of this!"" Judy then stomped out of the party and we have not spoken since. I asked my fiance what this was all about, and she just shrugged and said she was shocked and did not know what the problem was. I have tried unsuccessfully to figure it all out. The best I can figure is that Judy had had a crush on me and felt that Betty had taken advantage of me.

We were both married to other people and of course neither of us were interested anyway. Still, I was happy he remembered me and felt quite touched that he wanted to reconnect. Ok that's the back story. Here's the hard part. In February of this year,he suddenly posted on Facebook that he hard a heart condition and he only had a few months, or even weeks left to live, as no doctor would agree to do the necessary surgery. His heart was in really bad condition, he said, due to his previous drug addiction. I was stunned, and I messaged him about it. He said he was searching for a new surgeon who would agree to take on the risk. I even sent him a packet of Padre Pio's healing oil that I had, but a month or so later, he asked me if I had ever sent it, meaning he never got it. I'm not sure what happened. I thought maybe his wife took the package since it was from a woman, but that's just my guess as it is something I would have done. I found myself feeling really sad and thinking about him a lot, and contacted him often to see how he was doing. By March, he had found a doctor willing to do the surgery. After the surgery he wasn't online for awhile so I kept checking his page for any sign of that he was ok. Finally I messaged him, an he said the surgery went well but he was still afraid he was going to die. As for me, I knew he'd be fine. A few months passed, and I didn't hear from him.

It was a hard decision to make for the both of us. Initially we decided to come upon an agreement on who would have our children during the school week, weekends, and holidays. This is something we were not able to agree upon, and we knew that we both needed a lawyer. I had a feeling that this was going to be a nasty battle between us. Unfortunately, I was correct, the battle ended up being drawn out for three years. By this time the kids actually became of legal age to decide where they wanted to stay. To my surprise our children decided that they wanted to stay with me. Come to find out their mother had started seeing another mate who were abusive towards my Ex and our children. He had a drinking problem, and became violent when he drank. Our children have fond memories of when me and my Ex were together, and knew what a normal household would run like. The case was drawn out over the three years due to lack of proof showing that my Ex was an unfit mother and having an unstable household for our children to reside full time in. During those three years I worked on purchasing a home, and I thought it was necessary to remain single during this time. I felt my children did not need their dad to get into a relationship whenever they already had enough stress on their shoulders. I remember the day like yesterday whenever we were at court, and it was proved that my Ex was not only an unfit mother, but was unable to provide a stable home environment. Also, on top of everything our children each confessed to the courtroom how they prefer to reside in my home due to the hostile environment that they were encountering between my Ex and her new mate. They confessed how this was affecting them in school as well with their social lives.

There was no wedding planner and the only guests were the 2 witnesses that were necessary for the wedding to be considered official.  I didn't have an appointment with the stylist the morning of the wedding.  Rather, I pulled my hair back in an elastic tie and had my hair in a low pony.  I got my boys ready before I even got into the dress.  This involved fixing bow ties while I was still in a towel from the shower.  I wouldn't have it any other way, though.  I didn't like having all the attention focused on myself the first time around and it was nice to focus on others for a change.  As I mentioned before the road to the simple, yet happy occasion was one that was filled with gut wrenching guilt and sadness.  I don't believe anyone ever takes divorce lightly, especially when kids are involved.  The tears at night, the pain they express...none of that can ever be erased from my memory.  The tragedy of staying in a lifeless marriage would be to have my boys grow up to think that is how a marriage should be.  They both have huge loving hearts and it would be the ultimate failure of myself as as parent to stay and have their idea of love be tainted.   Their dad grew up with parents who have been in an acrimonious relationship his whole life.  He has never seen them kiss or show any affection.  He has only heard emotional and sometimes physical abuse.  I recognize that the cycle needed to stop and I felt that I owed it to my children to show what a healthy loving relationship looks like.

After getting an okay amount of money and supplies, I headed on a bus to the school in the beginning of February. I arrived in a hotel extremely confused as I was in a hotel different from where I was told I would be which gave me an overall bad feeling about the experience.

We first saw him when she saw a post on Facebook from the local animal shelter. She sent me a picture of the dog. He was very thin and looked very sad. We both felt very sorry for the dog. My wife saw the dog a week after we had moved into a new house. We had talked about getting another dog after we moved but ultimately decided against it. Our older dog is jealous of attention given to other dogs. We thought that he would be happier as an only dog. So when we first saw the dog at the shelter we talked about donating money to his care if he was picked up by a rescue group. However a few hours later neither of us could stop thinking about him. We called the shelter and were told that the dog needed more care than they could provide and that he wouldn't be kept there any longer. We decided that we had to go pick him up. We took the dog to a vet. They determined that he would need a blood transfusion but that it should wait until the following morning as the vet wasn't sure if he would survive the night. The next day the dog was given a blood transfusion. We were then able to take him home a few days later. We named him Pablo. Several months later he has gained weight and is more than twice the weight he was when we got him. He rather quickly adjusted to living with humans and has learned to use the bathroom outside. He is friendly and loving.

I then was placed on disability social security and suddenly found myself retired. Luckily, I just lost some use of my legs and went blind in my left eye, but better than those that suffered far worse then I.     Within this time, I became reacquainted with my very first kiss 48 years earlier. Her name was Debbie. While talking with her on New Year's Day 2019, she mentioned she was lonely, as was I.

When I got back up north, I still played in my mind the idea of moving down to Daytona Beach. My life as I knew it, was over in Ohio. No job, no children, friends were far gone. Thus, I took a big chance and decided to move down.     I found a home in June of 2019, that sounded great! It was furnished and the cost was affordable, thus I decided on it, and began to throw away all my furniture and everthing else from my long past.     When I finally moved down in late July of 2019, I got here and found that I was a victim of an internet scam by the woman selling me a place to live. There was no house. I had to live in a Motel 6 and an Airbnb until I could borrow money from my sister to find a home. The move itself now cost me $2000 and I have no furniture, forks, knives, dishes, pots, pans.....well I had nothing to put into it.     And it took me until the 3rd week of August to move in, and then I find out that a Hurricane is currently headed straight for Daytona Beach right now.

The first thing that came to mind was how fragile our lives are and that was scary. Also how quickly things change, almost in the blink of an eye.  During that time it happened I was taken aback because I just kind of coasted. I nor him ever even thought about life without each other so that alone scared me.

Please also don't live in fear because life is short so love the time you have here.

I was making good money, and having a good time while I was doing it. However, as they say, nothing lasts forever. Just when I thought things were finally settling in for me, I had a run in with my manager that left me questioning everything. I never thought he would treat me the way he did that day.

I didn't feel like showing up to work anymore, period! Later that day when I went home, I already began debating my future there. I knew my manager had treated other employees that way, but I just never thought it'd happen to me, since I always tried to be the best employee I could be.

I started by searching the internet for anything I could find. I was surprised at how much you could learn and how complex it could be but I didn't let it scare me; I continued in my quest to learn more. I was intrigued by just how many wild foods there were out there available for us to eat. It made me realize that people aren't using the natural resources we have and that there are a lot of things that are going to waste just because we don't know it's available to us. After a week of doing extensive research, I decided to go on a hunt and see exactly what I could find. I drove about an hour away to a location that was plentiful of forest and wildlife that I thought would suit me for my foraging needs. As I walked through the woods, I stumbled upon things I had not recognized from my research, so I had to use my best judgement about whether or not this was something that could be edible. I found a patch of wild berries that looked good so I decided to try my luck and eat one. They were very sweet and did not have a bitter taste, so I ate a few more before continuing on my way. Further on my travels, I saw some wild plants so I decided to pick them and take them home with me to see what I could do with them. This was turning out to be quite the interesting adventure. I heard a rustling noise behind me so I abruptly looked over my shoulder and realized that I had entered someone else's territory. Instead of seeing a person like I expected, I saw a beautiful deer standing behind me. It didn't run away like I thought, but just looked at me inquisitively, stopped to take in the sights and smells of nature, and then slowly walked away. At that moment, I thought to myself, people and animals aren't all that different. We are all here for the same reason; survival and to try and protect what is ours. As it started getting dark, I figured it was time to pack up and take my findings home.

I went from enjoying the college life to stressing about the future. The loss of my father had a profound impact on my studies and my view of the world. My mother and sister flew in from far away to watch me graduate. We spent the week together sightseeing and visiting places that we would enjoy.  We also visited places that my father would have enjoyed seeing such as Naval museums and where he used to live.  It was an emotional graduation ceremony because we all knew how hard I had worked over the past six years and that my father was not there to see it through.  There were many ups and downs, including transferring from a community college to a good university, family health issues, as well as money issues.

Around two years in it became absolutely unbearable for Sharon and she had to do something about it. After a large argument and much intervention, she ultimately told Sean that she needs to leave him if he did not quit drinking. She did not want to leave him but she was under the belief that this was the only thing that could get Sean to go back to his former self that she fell in love with. Initially, Sean took this terribly and told her if she really did not love him that she should just go then. She, reluctantly, left. Two days later Sean called her from a rehab center, saying that upon further reflection he knew Sharon was right and he decided to check himself in to rehab.

This kid is Asian and the other boys were making comments about his race but it was obvious that they were mostly intimidated by him because he consistently outperformed them in the class. This boy was a excellent student in both math and science and and he was also getting all A's in his other classes . The boys that were picking on him spent much of the their time in class goofing around and it was a daily struggle to get them to do their work. There were 4 boys in particular that seemed to spend quite a bit of time together and not much was spent focusing on their school work. I began to notice that they would be especially disruptive and bully the boy when it was close to test time and I was working to prepare the class. It seemed that since they were not doing well in the class that they felt the need to disrupt the entire class and be especially mean to the boy that was leading the class. I began speaking to the boys individually about their behavior and tried to get them to see how they were behaving and to instead focus on their schoolwork. The asian boys parents came to talk to me about the behavior as their son was hurt by the way he was being treated. The parents said they were concerned and asked that the school discipline the group of boys that were bullying their son, I again spoke with the group of boys , mostly individually to let each of them know that they should be focusing more on their school work and that what they were doing was not kind and instead hurtful. I could tell they understood , some more than others at first but it seemed that this approach began to make a difference as I began noticing each of them become more thoughtful and less concerned about how much better the boy they were bullying was doing than them in the class. I began offering tutoring to anyone that wanted extra help and one by one each of the group of bullies began asking for help. They had become aware that they were jealous and simply needed to work harder. I noticed that he boys began to respect the asian boy and instead of being being negative they began to show interest in learning. It seems they realized that just because they were not as far behind as they felt and that if they just began working harder they too can understand mathematics and science. It was especially rewarding when it was time for the science fair and each one of the group of boys that began the year as bullies were instead some of the most excited in the class to participate in the science fair.",1.0,A kid was being bullied and I stepped up for the kid.

It was located in Southern Colorado. My husband and I were needing a home and looking for a rental property, and this was a charming old house that was built in the late 1800's. Our landlord disclosed to my husband (not to me), that a previous tenant had committed suicide shortly before we were to move in. Knowing that we were already locked in and ready to move, my husband decided not to tell me about the situation for fear I would back out of the deal. It wasn't until we moved in and were settled that he shared the secret with me. The room that the tenant had killed herself in was my new office, and I had always had trouble breathing in there. There is no way to describe it other than the air was constantly sucked out of the room, so that if you were in there for any length of time with the windows and door closed, you literally could not breathe and would feel very faint, as though you needed oxygen or were going to black out. The first month we lived there, we would leave the light over the sink in the kitchen on. It would cut out at several second intervals throughout the night, which I could always see from my position in the bedroom while trying to go to sleep.

We first felt she was just going through a 'rebellious stage'. We were patient at first and tried to be supportive. The first time we found drugs (marijuana), we were calm with her but told her we never wanted to see these kinds of things in the house again.

After a day or two I think that I swayed the decision makers opinons that we should do something else and tell the hotel no, they cannot build here. After the meeting, we all went outside and looked at the natural wonders all around us. We watched the sun coming up through the trees as we heard the waterfall splashing off to our left. We heard the wildlife calling to each other through the trees, as the leaves rustled. We saw birds moving from tree to tree.

When I got fired I went into a bad depression and I didn't think I would be able to overcome the job loss. It took me a long time to start to feel better and to overcome the anxiety that went with it. I always worked hard for my boss and I went above and beyond my job duties. They felt that I didn't do enough so 5 months ago they decided just to replace me. I just came in one day and they informed me that my services were not needed anymore. I felt lost and also insulted that I would be thrown aside like that without any explanation. I tried to put things out of my mind by drinking and sleeping all day long. I couldn't understand why no one would hire me after this and it took many interviews to find something after they got rid of me. I hate to think back about it now and when I do I get really worried that it will happen again at any time. It has affected me mentally even at my day job now because I think back about the bad experience I had. I try to set it aside but it's always in my mind that I could be fired even if I make a small mistake. It has hampered my progress at times because I am worried about failure now. Not just in my professional life but also in my personal life. I try not to think back but for some reason the details of the event keep coming back to me and making me feel anxious and sweat.

After 6 years of marriage with my wife, we decided to separate. There are some things in life that cannot be reconciled, but when it comes to children, sacrifices must be made. A few months prior to our separation, my supervisor at the electronics factory advised me that I would have to begin working overseas in China due to the increased costs of production in our country, and if I refused, I would lose my job and status in the company indefinitely. I was devastated to hear this, my supervisor of  10 years put me in this tough situation of choosing whether i leave my family or leave my job. There were many things to consider, first off, after working under this supervisor for about a decade, I accumulated quite a lot of pay raises and perks to my job that made living easy for my family and I, and it wasn't easy to find the same things in another job. With my family, my daughter recently started middle-school and at this time in her life, it would be beneficial for her to make stable friends and develop relationships that last throughout her life. My wife didn't  like the idea of moving overseas because of her losing her job and our daughter's social health not being right. I did not know what to do in this situation whatsoever. I was angry with my supervisor for not offering me another position in the United States or referring me to another organization. I was also angry with my wife since she didn't want to come with me to China and start a new life over there. While i understood her concerns about not living there, I was still determined to pick up this new job position and continue working for the same company. Even though I made this tough decision and I knew this would come, my wife and I decided to separate because of this. In all honesty, separating was the hardest thing for me to overcome emotionally. We could not come to terms and agree on how things should be and for the sake of my daughter, we decided that my wife and her would stay in the USA while i travelled to China and lived there to do my work.",1.0,"my husband and i decided to separate.

He offers me a job on the spot saying that he would love to have such a kind person working with him. After a series of bad investments and bad luck, he eventually had to shut down the company. What I learned while working there was invaluable. I learned how to do things on my own and I now successfully work from home.

The most important of those reasons being that he and I had begun sharing our mental health issues with each other. Our issues had not been something we have been able to really discuss in the past. I thought we had reached a point where I would be able to share things with him and we could understand each other in that way.

She checked herself into the hospital with stomach pains and while under observation she developed a brain bleed which killed her. She was 65. When I try to remember the day it happened, when my brothers and I went to the hospital, it feels like I'm remembering a dream. I was in shock and my brain was in full blown panic mode, not only for that day but for weeks. Something that I do remember is seeing my mom hooked up to a breathing machine. I had assumed at that point that she was alive and in some kind of coma so I was talking to her, telling her things that were going on in my life. Later a group of doctors gathered us in a room and they were relaying the string of events that led to this situation. I remember, thinking my mom was in a coma, asking about the prognosis. The doctor non-chalantly told us that even though our mom was breathing mechanically she was actually dead. He didn't elaborate and moved on with the rest of the information he had to give us. I remember the way he said it made me feel like I was stupid. However I was still in shock so I didn't have the wherewithal to ask any follow-up questions. I did some googling and found out that when brain death happens it's common for hospitals to keep the body hooked up to breathing machines so they can harvest the organs later. I wish the doctor had explained that part better. Up until this point in my life I had been fortunate that I had not lost anybody close to me. I recently had friends that had both lost parents and I tried to be as consoling as I could but now that it's happened to me I've realized that there's not a lot anybody can say that will make you feel better. That death affects you profoundly. In my case it took roughly a month before I felt like my life was regaining any kind of balance and my mom and I weren't particularly close in the last few years of her life.

So it is with a sense of great difficulty that I write this summary in my mother-in-laws family journal. They say girls marry men like their father. After meeting John, I become a believer of that saying. He and I shared several traits. We both shared similar physical traits, tall, large builds, dark hair and eyes. We were interested in the same sports, though almost always for rival teams. A case of our geography. We had an appreciation for each others hobbies. He taught me how to enjoy fishing and I got him into woodworking. It was on a fishing trip that I first realized something may be wrong. He would be fine for several hours and then suddenly experience up to an hour of coughing fits. Fortunately we were dock fishing that day and after the second episode, I drove us back to our cabin. Right after that trip, my wife's parents sat us down to tell us about his illness. John was not the type to take things laying down. However, you could see the limitations he now had to endure were taking a toll on him. His wife, Martha, had to drive him since his coughing fits would come with times of difficulty breathing. My wife and I drove up at least once a month on weekends. Her sister and brother, living closer than us, were there more often. John would say he loved having the family around more often, though he didn't like being the center of attention. We found ourselves trying to occupy John in each of our own ways.

So I was with a tour guide taking a tour of the city when I somehow got separated from the rest of the group. At first I wasn't bothered, I figured out I would run into them pretty quickly. But as time went on I realized that they had most likely left me behind. I started to panic a bit, I had no idea where I was and no idea how to even figure out my current location. Even if I did, I probably would not have figured out how to get back to the hotel I was staying at. At first I thought it was a good idea to just wait here where I last saw the group, hoping that they would possibly come back looking for me if someone noticed I was lost. But then I decided to at least take a walk around, maybe noticing a landmark or something that would help me figure out what to do next. I guess I looked pretty foolish, like a tourist, because a native Philippine approached me and asked if I needed any help. I can't even tell you how glad I was that someone actually decided to come over to help me out. I'm really shy, so I have problems talking to strangers on my own. I explained to her my situation and she gladly decided to help me out. I told her the name of my hotel and she instantly new where to go. The ride on her bike was some of the most fun memories I ever had in my life. She pointed out a lot of the history and culture of her city on our way to my hotel, our conversation was entertaining. When we finally got there we decided to hook up the next day. She'd show me around the city more, which was was fine with me. The next few days we hung out together was pretty damn fun.

I went about 3 years being a glutton and a drinker, although never becoming an alcoholic. My ties were eventually broken with my fraternity, and I went completely down south, and gained quite a bit of weight. To this day I'm trying to finish my degree, but this story is about making change and maintaining discipline. About 6 months ago I decided enough is enough, and that I want to recapture my athleticism, my original form. Now, this didn't come easy, as I knew that if I were to stray any farther, that I may never get any better. This process was no easy task, and was less about obtaining a certain weight, as with all great things come with discipline and practice. I needed to get my diet straight, and to stop binge eating, and to take multiple small meals as opposed to one big one. More than that, I need an intense training regimen that would target a fat burning heartbeat, alongside High Intensity Interval Training. It was painful.

The knuckles of her right hand, however, are white with rage as she clutches her camera. She knows that in a matter of moments, the doors to the sanctuary will be flung open and the first notes of the processional will fill the air. Guests will rise and, as if in unison, arms holding camera phones will extend into the aisle. Those not sitting on the coveted aisle seat will raise their phone or tablet into the air. Not just family and friends, but co-workers and “plus-ones” — people with no vested interest in the bride cramming to get a photograph. Yes, she knows that in a few seconds, the church will be filled with Camera Phone paparazzi, rending her official task impossible. She grips the camera tighter and continues to breathe deep breaths. And then…she sees it. A selfie stick. She isn’t sure to whom it belongs, but it doesn’t matter. It is there, extended midway into the aisle. A Sword of Narcissism extending from the hands of a disrespectful guest. And something deep within her snaps. She gently places her camera on the floor behind her and begins walking down the aisle. She finds she no longer has control over her legs; they refuse to stop. She thinks, for a moment, if this is how it feels to be possessed. An almost out of body experience. She watches with fascination as a hand she recognizes as her own reaches out and yanks the selfie stick from its surprised owner. She grasps it with both hands and holds it high above her head, much the same way one would when presenting an item of tribute. And then, in one swift move, she raises her knee and brings the selfie stick down, breaking it in two. With a deep sigh of satisfaction, she hands both pieces back to the startled owner and makes her way triumphantly to her position at the front of the church.

I was driving my Ford Explorer down a windy road when a deer leapt out in front me. In an attempt to swerve around the deer, I jerked my steering wheel hard to the right towards a turn down a side street. However, the speed I was going at and the weight and unwieldiness of my car made me go careening off towards a house. With no real course of action at this point, luck had me slip directly in between two trees in this persons front yard, coming close enough to one to take off my side view mirror. Then a sharp ditch by their driveway slowed my vehicle enough to come to stop with little damage. Coming out of this, I had 3 of my 4 tires popped, a broken side view mirror, and a shattered window; but luckily no injuries myself. This has been on my mind nearly constantly since then, how differently it could have gone. I did lose my car, but I could have very easily lost my life. Or worse yet, I could have careened into that poor persons house and caused the death of someone else. After the accident the startled residents of the home came out to make sure I was ok. After sharing exasperated bewilderment at the luck of the scenario, I called a tow truck. The residents of the home were nice enough to offer me water and sit with me till the police and tow truck showed up. Luckily I have a bit of cash saved up for purchasing a new car, and hopefully my insurance premiums don't go up too much.

It was my first time ever being to the nation's capital, and with one day before my husband's surgery, we attempted to walk all over downtown DC and see as many monuments as possible before we had to be back at Walter Reed and ready for surgery the next morning. We traveled downtown on the Metro, and ended up getting off a short distance from the Capital, where we started. We then saw the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial (my main reason for wanting to go downtown!), the World War 2 Memorial, the Korean Memorial, and Vietnam Memorial. We then took the metro back to Walter Reed, where we were staying on base for the next couple of weeks. Side note, I was really impressed by the strategic placing of water vendors throughout the different monuments, with water, Gatorade, popsicles, etc. I don't know if it's a good use of their life, but we really appreciated them being there! The thing that stood out to me about the monuments was the realization that the Lincoln Memorial literally just had Lincoln's statue in it. I seriously thought that there might be more, maybe a museum commemorating his achievements or something, but it really had just his statue. I might have been a little disappointed, but still impressed at the imposing presence Lincoln was, even if just carved in stone. What also stuck out to me while we were downtown was the World War 2 Memorial. I honestly didn't expect to be impressed by that memorial. But the different quotes placed around the structure really helped the memorial pop in my mind. I enjoy reading, and reading wisdom from those gone before us, who went through such a horrific time.

I was sad. When we got to her school, and I pulled into the car rider ramp, she was greeted by her sisters' old teachers with big hugs and they walked her into the building. I cried, I cried ugly tears. She did it with such confidence and sure of herself and the kindness shown by the other teachers reassured me that she was going to be okay. She is my miracle baby and for 4 years, I have had her to myself while everyone else is at school and work. It has been she and I running errands and going to the park and Disney Channel on all day. Now, I come home to an empty house and I miss her.

When William had the opportunity to interview at the Chicago branch of his firm he was able to work in a visit to us in Grand Haven Michigan.  One of the first places we spent the day was the beach at Grand Haven.  We haven't seen in each other in person for such a long time that we spent half the day just talking at picnic table in the shade while watching the windsurfers play.  My partner Jamie knew of a little place we could get great sandwiches and picked them up for everyone as we scouted out a place on the beach to set up for the day.  Even though the beach was busy it was very relaxing.     If you've never been to a winery I can tell you that Traverse City has some fabulous locations to visit.  This was on Sarah's wish list and we were more than happy to take them up North to experience everything the near upper peninsula had to offer.  We left in the late afternoon to check into our hotel to visit the wineries early the next day when they opened.  On the drive there we took a detour to stop at Sleeping Bear Dunes.  William is a hobby photographer and really wanted to see a sunset from this vantage point.  It was a trek to the best location but it was amazingly worth it.  I think we were all ready to a good nights rest after the travel and hiking that day.  The wineries the next day were equally amazing and we learned a lot about the wines are made.  At least a couple of us enjoyed ourselves a little too much so it was a great idea that we'd decided to Uber from the hotel and back again.  They have some amazing restaurants in TC so after we had a couple hours to recover we took them to out favorite spot in town.  It was pretty busy for being the middle of the summer so we had to wait a little bit, but it was worth it.  They specialize in locally grown and sourced foods and really care about the quality and presentation.  We were happy our friends could experience this on their first trip to the states.      With only a few days of their trip left we took them up to Mackinaw Island for a day trip to experience what it's like to ride in a horse drawn carriage, and to ride on bikes to get where you need to go.  We had so much visiting all of the charming shops and taking in the scenery.  We were fortunate we had gorgeous weather that wasn't too hot for June.       We had such an amazing time visiting with out Irish friends that we're already talking about finding away to visit them in Ireland before they potentially end up moving to the states.

Hey! Vina is a friend app that acts a lot like Tinder. You set your preferences for what city you’re in and age limits, and then you swipe left for ‘I’ll pass’ and right for ‘I’d like to be friends, maybe.’ If you both swipe right on each other, then you match and you can send messages about meeting up. I felt weird using an app to make friends to begin with, because I felt like maybe it meant I was terrible at making friends in real life. But I gave it a shot and quickly matched with a few people in the area. However, despite attempting to make plans, only one of them actually followed up. We decided to meet at a coffee shop downtown that we both loved. The woman I was meeting, let’s call her ‘Ruth’, was already there when I arrived…but it took us seriously nearly 10 minutes to even ID each other. Firstly, Ruth didn’t look anything like her profile pic, which didn’t bother me like it would if I was on a date with a guy, but it did make it super hard to figure out who was her. Secondly, once we did find each other, it quickly became apparent that she was very, very sick. Like, coughing every three seconds and eyes red sick. While we ordered some coffee and found a seat, I tried to be sympathetic to her apologies for being sick, but I couldn’t focus on what she was saying between all the coughing. I hardly drank my coffee because I didn’t want to get sick. It was honestly a shame because Ruth was probably a very interesting person and we seemed to like some similar things. But I couldn’t shake the thought that somebody who shows up to meet a stranger this sick might be too desperate to make a friend. When we walked out and Ruth said she’d love to meet up again and I agreed, I already knew I didn’t really mean it.

After several days, I began to find it difficult to distinguish between what was reality and what was illusion; a common symptom of insomnia. The most unsettling perception I encountered was a group of children unknown to me. They were playing together in a field within a park. As they ran around, they began to extend their hands toward a nearby playground. I could see some kind energy emanating from their fingers. Almost instantly after this began, the metal implements on the playground began to move on their own. Some tore out of the ground and began to whirl around in mid air. The children were creating their own magnetic waves and were thus able to manipulate metal around them. It reminded me of the character Magneto from the X-Men comics, though the children did not appear to have any malevolent intent. When I finally snapped out of this vision, I was honestly uncertain about whether or not what I had seen was real. Sleep deprivation had obviously gotten the better of me. It wasn't until my finals were over that I was finally able to get some sleep.

We wanted to keep our family together, so we all moved together, my husband, me, and our two children who are also in elementary school. I decided that for awhile I will be a stay at home mom and take care of our two boys while they are in their younger years. I think my teaching background will help with this and make it a good experience for them. I was very sad to leave my job because I love my coworkers and students. My students have always been great, and they gave me little cards that they made to wish me good luck in the future and told me that they will miss me. At the same time, I think there will be an opportunity for me in the future to become principal of a local school in our new area. I had thought about moving up like this for awhile and might have the opportunity a few years down the road. I have enrolled in a graduate program to prepare me for this next step in my journey and will be able to dedicate more time to it since I will be staying at home with the kids and will have some time during the day while they are at school. It was difficult for me to leave everything I knew and the city I grew up in to move away with my husband, but I think it will also open new doors and new opportunities for me. I have needed a little push to get me going in the direction I want to be going, and this might help me take the leap and go the next step in my career. My husband is very happy about his promotion and transfer, and I think this will end up being a promotion for me as well. My students and I all took a picture on my last day and I have it framed in our new house. It was hard and tear-filled when I had to say goodbye to my colleagues and leave the building with a box of my stuff. Most surprising to me has been that several of my students parents have reached out to me on social media, so I think that will be a nice way to keep in touch with my roots and not completely lose touch with my home town. I have become friends with one parent in particular who I always viewed as a difficult parent, but she is very well-meaning and wants the best for her children and I have a completely different view of her now that we are friends and not just seeing each other in parent-teacher meetings. It is interesting to see different sides of people and see things you didn't think you would see. The other thing that was difficult for me was that our new town is smaller than our old one and it seems a little bit more difficult to meet people but I am hoping that being in school will help with that, and I might try to start some social groups, which is something I had always thought about doing.

I've been trying to grow sugar maples in tissue culture for three years and have not had much success. In May, I was able to get three times the number of plants to survive than I've had in the last two years. These plants that have survived have continued to survive and I've been able to experiment on them with different media components and hormone concentrations to get some of these plants to root. The plants need to have roots to really thrive and without them, they can't live for very long. Last month I was able to find a hormone concentration that is starting to stimulate root production. This is very exciting and gives me a lot of satisfaction because there wasn't much information in the published literature to use as a guide. I had to take information from different plant species and come up with my own concentrations and trials. In science, we have a lot of frustration. We have to constantly repeat experiments and come up with new ideas. It's fun and challenging but it also comes with stress and frustration. We have a grant for this work, so it's been tough to have this project not work well. If we need to reapply for additional funding, it would be tough to justify it for a project that's not working. The maple trees I'm working with are higher sugar producing tress that are valuable for maple sugar growers as they get better syrup from the sap of those trees.

We were having a family get together for my sisters birthday and most of the family was there. Aunt comes in late, as usual, with her bratty daughter (15) in tow. Aunt places her purse by the front door. It's a huge monstrosity of a bag that is open at the top. This will be important later. They complain about the food all through lunch. We just ignore this and continue with fun of the day. After lunch, the parents are all drinking coffee in the dining room while the younger kids play and watch movies in the salon by the front door. Entitled cousin does not want to watch the movie that is on, I think it was Frozen, saying it is lame and is a kids movie.  She takes the remote and changes it to Game of Thrones. All the other kids are mad and complain that the show is too scary.  A tussle ensues for the remote and in the course of the wrestling, Aunts bag is knocked over and items scatter onto the floor.  My Sister comes in and tells everyone to quiet down, changes the show back to Frozen and takes the remote which makes Entitled cousin cry and scream that Nephew hit her and wants him punished. Aunt comes in and yells at Nephew that Cousin should have what she wants and for Nephew to stop being a brat. Then Aunt sees her bag knocked over and starts screaming at Nephew that he is stealing from her. She picks up her bag and says her FitBit is missing. I roll my eyes because of all the crap in that bag, how would she know immediately that her FitBit is missing. Aunt demands Nephew turns his pockets out. Nephew says he does not have her FitBit and to leave him alone. Sister tells Aunt that her Nephew does not have her FitBit and maybe she should look under the couch where her bag fell over. One of the other kids does just this and does find her FitBit. Aunt yells at Nephew saying he stowed it there for later so Sister tells Aunt that this is rediculous and it is time for them to leave.",1.0,My aunt and nephew got into a huge fight over false accusations.

They had both lived but their father had gotten paralyzed. He'd been depressed since the accident since he'd always been an active man but now couldn't do that anymore.

They say food is the best medicine, and I found, perhaps serendpitiously, a product at Costco that provided great relief from this medical condition, which can now be classified as parasitic infection according to my recent blood work results. It happened roughly 2 months ago, but I will describe in detail what the product is and why it helps my condition. Looking at it from a broader perspective, this event was magnificent and a relief, as it offers tremendous hope for the future, and for others that may have similar woes. Whilst browsing for cheeses in the cheese isle at costco, there was a particular brand that stood out to me. It said, ""New York Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese"" on the package label. What is so special about New York extra sharp cheddar cheese, I thought. I've tried so many cheddar cheese brands before, but with little to no benefit. It turns out that this particular one uses annatto as a food coloring. In general food coloring is regarded as detrimental to one's health, but annatto is unique. It doubles both as a spice and a food coloring agent. The spice is mild and not usually detectable by our bodies. After eating this cheese, something special happened. The parasites that have been plaguing me for decades started imploding and there was a mass exodus that I do not wish to describe in detail, but it involved running to the bathroom 30-40 times in the span of 5 hours. But why? Why did this agent work when so many other expensive medical treatments and anti-parasitic medicines have failed in the past? In this case, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. All the individual components of the cheese are important. Annatto is an anti-parasitic agent according to the medical literature. It offers numerous benefits in terms of health and is a relatively common spice used in cooking. Combined with the minuscule amount of milk sugar in the cheese, often referred to as whey, the overall effect is synergistic.",4.0,"I discovered a product at costco that offered tremendous hope for my medical issue.

The work was very hard but rewarding.  There is one case in my mind that sticks out in particular and that is the case of Client. (name omitted).  Every week, the intern group would head to local facilities where immigrants seeking asylum were held.  The group would give a presentation to the detainees about the services we provided and their rights as detainees.  At the end of the presentation,  one man walked directly up to me and began telling me his story.  The man said that he was from Eritrea.  He had been a professor there, and was persecuted for speaking out against the local government.  He had been jailed in a facility without windows for seven months and was subsequently released to return to work as a professor, this time with government agents sitting in on all of his lectures.  After one session in particular, Client felt as if he was going to be arrested and imprisoned again, and he set out to flee Eritrea, which he did successfully.  With the help of a false passport (his home government had confiscated his), and extended travels through three countries, Client arrived in America where he was subsequently detained.  After hearing his story, I decided to take him on as a client to help him gain asylum.  Over the course of 4 weeks I studied endlessly, learning everything there was to know about Client and asylum laws. A great deal of time was also spent with Client rehearsing the details of his long and harrowing journey and detailing the precise reasons he needed to be granted asylum.  At the end of the four weeks, the moment of truth arrived.  I entered the courtroom with Client and waited patiently.  After what seemed to be an eternity, our case was finally in front of the judge.  They called Client to the stand and we began the direct examination.  The examination was perfect.  Everything that Client and I had prepared for was executed seamlessly.  We were so thorough and convincing that the other examining party had minimal questions for Client and gave minimal push back to the idea that asylum was absolutely necessary for my client.

I planned on making a tea out of the mushrooms, I read somewhere on Reddit that if you boil water and let the mushrooms sit in the hot water all of the bad alkaloids that cause nausea wont be there and that the effects wont be as strong. Anyways, after brewing the tea I decided that I should sit down and start enjoying my freshly brewed magical tea. About halfway through the cup, I felt butterflies building up in my stomach.

Even though it was beautiful, I wasn't sure if it was the one for me, so I kept trying on more.

So, I tried on the first dress again, this time with a veil, and my mom and I both knew--that was the one. The best part of the story comes next, though! At this bridal salon, they allow the first bride who purchases a dress to give it a name (like a human name), and my dress had never been purchased before. So, I got to name my dress after my maternal grandmother, who died fourteen years ago, and who my mom and I miss very much. We both cried!

You might not find my story to be anything spectacular, but for me, it has been the one most singularly amazing event of my life. It was the day that I met my husband. He came into my life and affected me in so many ways and for which I really do not have words to describe. Yet, I will try my best to portray how his coming into my life completely changed me and gave me a whole new world to look at. One of the things that I noticed immediately when I met my husband was how safe and secure he made me feel. I remember meeting him that very first day and realizing how good I felt just being with him. It was as if a burden had been lifted from my shoulders. I suddenly felt free and relaxed, as if I had to worry about nothing in life ever again. He would be very supportive of my ideas and my decisions and would encourage me to go ahead and do what I wanted the most. He provided me with the background support that I had always needed to further to my plans but had felt so insecure before. He had a knack of making me laugh and feel good about myself and whatever was going on at that time. Aside from making me feel emotionally stable, safe, and secure, he also made me feel very secure financially. He made it look so easy, as if I would never have to worry about money ever again. He made me feel that I could trust him with no matter what. This is perhaps the reason that I married him in the first place, because of how he good he made me feel about myself: very safe, secure, and sound",2.0,My husband taught me so many things that have impacted me and changed the way I think and feel.

I didn't want to. I could feel my heart racing and myself getting more nervous. She told me ""Are you a chicken?"" and I told her no.

So he confessed me that earlier that day he tried to take his own life, I got super scared I didn't know what to say or how to react, I stood quiet for a couple of seconds , and then realized that the best thing he could have done was to tell me because in that way I could help him to get the help he needs. I told him how brave he was for telling me , and how happy I was that he trusted me so much for talking about something that is not easy to say, I told him not to worry about and that there is a lot of people in the world dealing  with depression and how there is a lot of help available for those that want to get better. I told him that I was going to stay there with him and that I was not going to leave him alone in this journey.

Later during the drive, the bus driver attempted her best to not doze off.  During the last leg of the trip she swerved a few times. To keep herself awake, she started to hum.

My daughter didn't get much sleep the night before our trip, and she had hoped she would make up for it during our bus ride.

It also seemed silly to celebrate an organization that demonstrated time and time again that it didn't care about me or my peers. Let's be honest with ourselves, university functions are rarely about the students themselves and their accomplishments. That said, I somewhat regret not walking because a few of my peers did. We were a class of 9 and about half of us chose to attend the graduation ceremony. My peers were what made graduate school worthwhile. They helped me learn and supported me like no other. While, yes, I had a few professors who taught me a great deal about my particular concentration, the overall impression that I was left with by the faculty was that I was labelled as a lost cause (and too fat to be taken seriously... but that's a different story). For as much as my family insisted that this was an accomplishment, it didn't feel that way. It felt more like a significant waste of my time, energy, and capital. It has been hard to fully process all of my feelings about graduating. I wish I felt proud, but I was unpleasantly surprised to find that I  mostly felt lost, worthless, and full of resentment.

The police were rather aggressive with the other drive as it became very apparent that he was drunk.

Making it to the airport and pulling out my passport was pretty cool too. The whole setup felt like I was in some kind of movie. I was ready to go on some kind of mission where I would reach the ultimate heights of relaxation. Really, I was just happy to get away for a bit. Getting onto the plane and seeing Miami slowly fade away from view was nothing short of amazing. I must admit it was a wondrous day.

Attending his funeral was very emotional. I was in tears the whole time I was in the room with his body.

That's all the time he had with his wife: 4 years of dating, 2 years of marriage, and then dead, with no kids to pass on his legacy, all because of a distracted driver. It made me so incredibly sad and also furious at how unfair life is. At the funeral we were encouraged to get up and say a few words. Some of his family did get up, but so did a few people that only seemed to be doing it to draw attention to themselves, like, ""I know he is dead, but have you thought about how *I* feel about it?"" which only made me more mad. Although I hate speaking in front of people, I did go up to talk about what he meant to me. I did not mention how I felt about the other hangers-on who got up to talk, because that would have been very inappropriate for a funeral, but instead tried to draw the focus back to what a wonderful human being this man was. How I never saw him angry, how I never saw him complain, how he always was so fun and jovial and approached each day like a blessing.

We watched seagulls play. Our children stayed by us. Their laughter made us happy. We knew we would still have problems when we left but we had time to just rest and not think about them. I didn't want to bring up those problems but I knew they wouldn't go away. I started to talk about them but my husband said they will still be there when we left. We should enjoy the time together now, he said. I wanted to but my mind kept thinking of how when we left things would be the same. I didn't want that. I said alright maybe later on we can discuss solutions to them. He said that would be fine. He said right now let's enjoy being with our children. We are only down here two days he reminds me. I don't want to spend it thinking about the daily grind back home. We didn't have any big problems waiting for us. For that I was grateful.",1.0,"Recent family beach vacation.

We both go to college and live in the same dorm building. She always had this pattern of making up excuses for not seeing me, or communicating with me. It has gone on since the begining of last year, we would try to do something of a routine together but she would always fail to commit. Last year it was running, then the next semester was going to gym, then this fall we decided we would try going to yoga. She had gone the first night with me, but she evaded it 3 times in a row after that. I told her over the summer that she would have to actually make an effort to reach out to me and be my friend. She claims I would never text her but I made my attempts and she did not reciprocate like a friend would. She would also get back together with her abusive ex multiple times, like my advice did not matter. She would also hang out with people she claimed to hate. She did this out of lonliness. She made me feel used, where before she would invite me to her room all last year to complain about her ex, which I would listen to, when they are both okay after the 4th time getting back together, I was cast to the side. So when she kept avoiding me, I gave it to her straight over text that I miss her friendship and that I did not need this support in my life right now, and that we were growing apart, she lashed out at me. She claimed I was too sensitive and how I was the problem and that we would still be friends if I wasn't so sensitive. She said it in a much ruder tone though. I avoid her now, and I still feel the hurt from all of that. I only wish it could have ended more amicably because thats how I approached her.

That was my real blood father. Take into account he lives about four states away and time that has passed between visits was around six years. Now just because we live far apart doesn't mean we don't have a good relationship, we do it's just that while I was little he had to move away so he could make money to live. I didn't understand this at the time but as I am a adult now I understand this more than ever. What helped me understand this more was the fact that I now have kids myself and I get that you always do what is best to provide for them.

He asked me a bunch of questions and several times veered into personal territory, or asked awkward questions.

I guess that's why you're married now - you were like a sack of bones."" So... not the most tactful guy. Of course I made a face when he said that, a somewhat surprised and skeptical face so he realized he had been unpleasant and apologized profusely.

I remember these six months well, because there were a lot of life changes that I had to make and throughout the months I learned more and more about myself than I did last year. Within the last six months, I moved out of my parents' house for the first time; I had a lot of anxiety moving out (especially since I have an anxiety disorder, among other mental illnesses) and the fact that I had to do it suddenly made the anxiety worse. My boyfriend's roommates decided out of the blue that they were going to move out and there was a risk that him and another friend of our would be homeless. Now, at that point in my life I had a part-time job that paid well enough that I could move in and pay rent -- I had expected to movie in with my boyfriend by May when their lease was up but the past roommates decided to move out in February.  Thus, I was not as mentally prepared and had a lot of trouble coming to terms with the fact that I needed to move out of my parents house eventually. I am 24 years old and struggled with severe depression for a large portion of my life. Some times I feel that I am still struggling but since I had moved that struggle became less and less severe. I have gotten to the point where I have a good handle of my anxiety and depression and try to push past them. This came with the move, as my previous home environment was very hostile: my parents fought and argued all the time. Thinking about it, they have always been fighting since I had remember, and moving out was a right step in the direction to get out of that toxicity. I still struggle with my mental illnesses but they became less and less significant and more manageable than I ever felt before. I knew getting out of a toxic environment was a path to better mental health but I didn't realize how beneficial it was until got out of it. Within the past six months I have lost weight, nearly 10lbs, and have a much more positive head space. Because of this, I was able to eat healthier, stop stress eating, start exercising, being more social, etc. A lot of positive things happened that still affect me significantly to this day. As for my parents... well, I love them very much and it was heartbreaking to see my mother cry when I started packing up and moving out. My mom loved me dearly and she would do anything for me and my brother; however, I needed to leave the nest. I do visit often, I try to keep in touch at least once  or twice a week. Unfortunately I've been doing this less often lately because every time I go there the fighting and arguing continues. I addressed this problem before but my parents didn't quite understand why I was so upset by this. It also didn't help that there was a language barrier and they were born in another country. Since there was no way for me to stop the arguing I had to be the one to leave. It was a hard decision but I'm much happier for it.",1.0,Within the past six months I moved out of my parent's house and starting living on my own.

Of course we wanted to spend as much time with them as possible, so we all got up at four in the morning.  The first morning, by about 6:00 in the morning, he had already eaten breakfast and was ready for some ice cream.  We all ate ice cream cones at about six in the morning! That was a lot of fun!

From that moment on, every childhood fantasy of my wedding day was coming at me at lightning speed. I knew then that I would need to do something to stay organized and to remember every moment of the most wonderful time in my life. That’s when I turned to a wedding journal. When I tried to keep journals in the past, I would just use a notebook or loose paper, only to find that a month later I had either abandoned the notebook or lost the sheets of paper. So, this time I decided to take a different route when a friend gave me To Have and to Hold, A Wedding Journal. Ironically, but appropriately, the guided journal is published by the My Chaotic Life division of Walter Foster Publishing. I soon found out that chaos is the catchphrase when you are planning a wedding. I enjoyed using a guided journal for discipline, but using a journal that is blank inside is just as helpful. I know because I kept one of those, tooThe guided journal helped to keep me focused but I soon discovered that there were things missing that I really wanted to include. For example, Jeff and I decided to write a short piece that we would read to each other after we exchanged our vows. There wasn’t a space in the guided journal for me to jot down thoughts or ideas for this “untraditional” element, so I added notes on this into the pages of my personal wedding journal.

I had been going through a bit of a rough patch since I broke up with my gf of 3 years and this was exactly what I needed. Speaking of, the festival itself was fantastic.  I hooked up with a few people still left in town from HS that I grew up with and the first day we pregamed pretty good before we went.  They had plenty of live music and people from all over the state came with almost anything you could want.  My favorite parts were the garlic and cheese sections, the garlic people were set up in front on days 1 and 2 while the cheese folks were in the spotlight on days 4 and 5.  One of my friends actually got me to be on the panel for judging dishes there as well, which I couldn't thank them for enough.  It was so much fun and I got to get a bunch of recipes to bring back home with me!  Plus, I got to meet a chef from a few towns over who has their own show on the Food Network.  For someone who loves cooking as much as me, I felt like I was meeting an idol almost! Other than that, we spent a lot of time out in nature, bringing Sasha with us to our favorite lake to swim in from when we were kids.  My friends and I even spent a few days hiking even deeper into nature and pitching tents for a mini camping trip.  It was definitely one of my favorite visits out here!  I was able to completely get back in tune with myself and let nature and people boost me back up when I was down.",1.0,"I went on a summer vacation to Vermont.

This happened to me about 3 months ago, where I completely hit a wall in my job at the time. I had been working as a Staff Accountant for a nationwide retail pharmacy chain for about 4 years. I took the job right out of college and thought it would be great. It was a huge company so I knew my job would be stable, and if I wanted to move around a bit I figured that I would be able to. Well, after 4 years of small raises and no real big opportunities, I decided that it was time to chase my passion and look for new work about 3 months ago. I was such a small cog in this company since it was massive so I felt that my work was not meaningful. A family friend of mine had recently started a job in sales at a very small board company responsible for some big hit games, and they were looking to fill out their accounting department. Taking this job would be a risk, but board gaming is something I am passionate about and this company was so small. Anything I did in that job would be noticed by everyone. I would be making a real impact in my work. I decided to throw caution to the wind, and apply for the job. I've now been here for 2 months and I love it. The work I do is meaningful, I care about my company, and I am excited to come in to work each and every day. I am so happy I took this risk and chased my passion and left my dead end job.

I'm 46 years old and I rememeber the 1986 Davis reunion as it was held at the Brewster Gun Club in Brewster, Ohio.  If I were to guess, I would say that there were at least 50 people there, possibly more.  I can't say for sure, because no photo was taken.  The other Davis family reunion was in 1973 and was held at the American Legion in Beach City, Ohio, which is about five miles south of Brewster.  I was only five months old and obviously don't remember it.  But, a group photo was taken and my cousin Shawna has me in her lap.  Well, fast forward to February 2019.  I got to thinking about the Davis family tree and thought it was about time someone put together a long-overdue reunion.  Thanks to Facebook, I was able to reach out to several relatives, and even discovered a few more that were out of state.  It would have been cool to have it at the aforementioned Brewster Gun Club, but it no longer exists.  It has been replaced by an apartment complex.  BUT, the Beach City American Legion was still in existence so I got ahold of the commander and he was more than happy to have us rent out the place.  The cost was only $150 which I thought was appropriate.  My wife and I probably spent a good 80-90 percent of the overall cost of the reunion.  A good chunk of that was renting a U-Haul truck because of all the tables, chairs and barbecue grill.  That, and the reunion was 85 miles from our house!  Needless to say, it was a lot of work getting the reunion set up and of course, taking it down and cleaning up.  We left our house at 6am and didn't get home till midnight. The reunion itself had about 35 people attend, some of which I hadn't seen since the last reunion in 1986!  There were a few that weren't in attendance that I would have loved to have seen.  Just seeing old relatives reconnecting after so many years almost brought a tear to my eye.  My one cousin wants to do a reunion every year, but I am thinking maybe every two years.

All of my family were in attendance, which was a great thing as most of us haven't seen one another in many years.

He fathered six children and had 9 grandchildren and 7 great grandchildren and they were all in attendance to honor his home going! Just two years before, in the same month I did my father's funeral and everyone was in attendance there as well. I mention this because at my grandfather's funeral the place was packed, save one empty chair. It was a touching thought that there was one chair left in honor of my father. I mentioned this in the eulogy and hoped that all in the family who know that there is a chair in our home and at the table for everyone one of them! During the funeral I preached a message as well on the lives that are lived as an anchor for others. My Grandfather was most certainly and anchor for all of us as well as grandpa and grandmas house was an anchor for our souls when traveling into town. I also expressed how our faith anchors us in the decisions that we make in life. That many time we can drift too far off course and that life has a way of blowing from our course through storms. Although the winds of life are experienced by everyone, we do not have to allow them to shipwreck us or our faith. Through faith and trust we hold on and are anchored to the rock! This was the way that my grandpa lived and that is the way that I hope to live my life as well. In all it was a bitter sweet event for me and there were tears of sadness and of joy.

That stuff is hard for me, seeing a dead body and the person not being inside of it anymore. The viewing and funeral went very well though.

I had hoped so strongly that this would be the opportunity for us all to be loving and supportive of each other. Instead, the abuse was just as awful as I had ever endured; except now they extended the mistreatment to my daughter, as well.

Mythological stories, as well as the ideas of classic history, became increasingly reverted back to with the start of Neoclassicism. Rationality and tradition were rediscovered and implemented into artwork more frequently in the mid-eighteenth century; these key thoughts made up the ideals of Neoclassicism; the classical revival in European art. One of the great artists of the time was Baron Francois Gerard, whose oil painting of Cupid and Psyche in 1798 represented a true masterpiece of the Neoclassical period due to its overall focus on the main characters in the narrative while integrating powerful symbolism and creating a high quality of realism. Baron Francois Gerard’s 1798 painting of Cupid and Psyche portrays Psyche sitting on a grassy hill-like area. She is shown with a very vacant and far-off gaze as if observing something in the distance. Her posture is relaxed yet her arms are almost in a folded position over her bare body.

This past May she had a routine PET scan done and we were called in within a few days to meet with the doctor. He told us that her PET scan showed she had experienced an aggressive transformation of the leukemia and would have months to live unless she tried a treatment that might give her a little more time. She opted to take the treatment rather than give up and go on a home hospice plan. She has moved in with me and since the last diagnosis has lost her ability to speak for the most part. She can say simple words but will say yes for no and vice versa. She knows she is jumbling her words up but can't help it. Her MRI brain scan shows she has had no strokes at all. The doctor is afraid the CLL has infiltrated her brain. She will have a lumbar puncture this Tuesday to test her spinal fluid. The doctors don't know exactly why she has lost her speech. I am taking her to all doctor appointments and helping her to stay organized. It breaks my heart to see my mom lose her independence and strong mind.

That stay at the hotel changed my life. I met my now girlfriend there and we spent the week together in California. We had such a wonderful at Coronado beach and San Diego. We went to the zoo, saw seals laying near the ocean, went bike riding along the beach and shared countless meals that week. I truly believe that I met my soulmate three months ago at that bar in the hotel. We shared our thoughts, memories, stories, struggles, hobbies, families, childhood stories and just about everything else. I don't think I stopped smiling since I met her. When she asked me if I wanted to move in with her, which required me to move across the country to California, I was hesitant at first but I couldn't say no. I knew that I would lose her if we tried to do a long distance relationship. She said she would support me while I find a job out in California and while that was nice, I was still very worried. What kind of person just quits their job and moves across the country? Well, I decided that since I am young to go for it. If the relationship did not work out, I always wanted to live in a warmer climate anyway. Lucky for me I ended finding a great job in my field right away and drove across the country to live with her. Our time together so far has been a dream.

We finally decided on an affordable spot that wasn't too far away from our previous homes, and we moved in together. This was my first time ever living with a romantic partner, and also her first time as well. In addition, it was a new experience in that we did not have an HOA. Both of us were used to living in one, and having to pay dues for that as well as follow a color scheme. I loved that I no longer had to conform to the rules and regulations of a seemingly pointless organization. To celebrate this, my partner and I decided to explore the area to find things to decorate our new yard with. We found an old school nursery nearby, (even the main business sign was a big piece of hand painted wood), and we bought some plants. Well, about 18 plants to be exact, and all but two of them were fruit or vegetable producing. So we planted these outside in our new yard to harvest. Besides the lack of HOA, we also didnt have to worry about pet fees, which was another thing neither of us were used to. Naturally, we had to celebrate this as well. Instead of a traditional dog or cat, we ended up getting 5 pets. These include 2 leopard geckos (one albino one regular), a veiled chameleon, a roboroverski hamster, and a havana rabbit.

Thee months ago was the start of the truth but the story is even older by another four years. Our relationship was a long distance one spanning an entire ocean, time zones were a constant challenge but somehow it always worked. I was a college graduate with a Masters in Bio Engineering and se was a post grad working towards a career in medicine. We would speak twice minimum every week for at least ninety minutes and spend two weeks together twice a year, once in my hometown and once in hers. Most of the four years went on without a hitch but I could tell in the fourth things were changing a bit. Our phone calls became slightly shorter and a bit less detailed. We missed a few of our annual get togethers, we were pulling back a bit. I decided then that is was now time to make an extra effort to close that wide ocean separating us and took a dive. It took a great deal of effort and deep discussions with he in the six months leading to the wedding but still there was something off.  The wedding planning was smooth and very little went wrong. The week of the wedding or families were together and getting along well. The day of the wedding was perfect and we both agree we wouldn't want anything different. We opted out of a traditional honeymoon, well it was already a big logistical debacle anyway. Excited to begin our life we discussed our future and for me living away from my home that I have known for so long. Thats when I leaned the truth, she was not amazing. She was not a post grad student working towards a medical degree. She was once but not now, she is not amazing in that sense but she is my beautiful and loving wife.

The 16 year olds are twins (just for the record).  In the middle of those, I have an 18 year old daughter.  She has always been fairly quiet and somewhat reserved, but has been a good kid and we rarely have had to worry about her.  She decided several years ago that she wanted to graduate from high school with an associates degree.  My wife and I both thought this was a great idea and we fully supported her in doing this, but we also advised here that it would be a lot of work. When she got to high school, she got right into it.  Initially, at least, she needed some help figuring out how to go about knowing what classes to take, etc.  She also couldn't start the ""early college"" program until she was a junior (11th grade).  She worked hard and put in a lot of effort between her 11th and 12th grade years.  We were very pleased to see what she was doing. This past April, she graduated with her associates degree in general studies (with honors) a month ahead of her high school graduation.  The following month, she graduated from high school with honors.   I was very proud of her and thought she had done an outstanding job.  We thought the future for her looked bright. A few weeks after her high school graduation, I discovered a number of messages on her instragram account, which were on a shared cell phone we use as the ""home"" phone.  The messages were between her and a relative and were extremely vulgar, crude and inappropriate.  My head hurt more than it ever had after reading these messages because my view of my daughter had changed and not for the better.  I was disappointed and distressed to have this happen. Shortly thereafter, in early June, while I was at work, she told my wife that she was leaving.  She packed up some of her things , walked out the door, and left.  I have not spoken to her since, although we know where she is.  I have been heartbroken about this and have not known what to do about the situation.

He had full-on delusions and wanted to argue you with me over scientific principles that were non-existent.  He claimed that all plants have psychedelic properties and that he could make DMT out of the mimosa trees that grow near our house.  I found him passed out at the base of a poor tree that had been hacked halfway out of the ground with a garden trowel.

Her health had been in decline for years so while it wasn't unexpected it was still difficult. After she lost the ability to walk to diabetes we moved her to a nearby nursing home that specialized in employing caretakers that spoke our native language. There weren't many choices and my father worked hard to get her into this particular one which was highly regarded in the community. We visited her at least once and often two or three times a week to bring her meals to help her adjust. Unfortunately she never quite adjusted to the loss of freedom and autonomy. This went on for about four years and despite how routine it was every visit was different. Sometimes she'd have conflicts with other residents and sometimes with nurses and caretakers. She changed rooms five times during her stay which I believe was more than anyone else has. Every attempt to make things better seemed to have made some things worse. I simultaneously feared going back every week and got terribly anxious being away. Probably the biggest challenge was getting her to eat enough. She hated the food so we tried to bring her home cooked meals as often as we could but this only made her dislike the nursing home's food even more. We kept her fridge fully stocked at all times but because she hated the nursing home food so much she felt the need to save food from home for a later time. Early this year after a particularly bad illness she stopped eating altogether and had to be forced. She passed away a few months after that.

We are definitely not as close as we were before any of this, and there has been no real attempt by either of us to repair our relationship.

He played a major role in my upbringing, was a massive influence in my life, and a very positive influence to that matter. Thankfully, I have been able to visit him a few times since the last writing, and have been in contact with him via text messaging quite a bit.  Unfortunately, in the last few weeks he has taken a turn for the worse, and is now back in the hospital again after being released for a short period of time. Two days ago we found out that his platelet count has dropped very low after receiving chemo treatment, which he never really wanted to have done in the first place. He says he has made his peace, and whatever happens is whats going to happen, and doesn't think it is worth it to keep racking up such high medical bills when there is no chance the chemo will be able to save his life. I am having a hard time with this, and am finding it very difficult to accept. I know that this how things go when someone is diagnosed with something such as this. But the man is like a father to me, and I'm not really sure where I am at emotionally at the moment. Thankfully I have a good support system in place with my wife, and friends, and they are really helping to keep the negative emotions at bay.  At this point, the doctors have no real expectations of how long he'll survive, as every time something positive happens, it seems like something equally as negative happens. But just like I said in my last entry, I am going to keep doing my best to stay positive, and keep hoping for the best.

My Uncle Eric died. Just a week prior he had been diagnosed with cancer and we were unsure of the prognosis. He wasn't even 50. He lived about 3 hours away from us and my parents were going back and forth to be with him and planned on bringing him to live with them had his prognosis turned out better. The worse part is that my moms sisters filed paperwork with the court to try to control what happens to his body. Eric was autistic and needed a guardian because he couldn't completely take care of himself and needed help with decision-making. All Eric wanted was to be buried next to his parents. He wanted nothing to do with these sisters and actively avoided having them in his life. His parents were cremated and he was aware that he already had a plot next to theirs and that he would be cremated too. The sisters took us to court trying to get control of his trust and his life insurance. I was so upset knowing this wasn't about Eric and his best interest. It was about them trying to get their hands on his money, which my mother controls. My mother didn't ask for this, she was designated by her own parents, yet her sisters have it out for her as if she had done something wrong. They have always been low-life's, hell bent on hurting others so none of this was shocking to us. We barely had any time to prepare but showed up to court with a huge binder of evidence of things they had both done, text messages from Eric, messages from granny from when she was alive, proof of crimes one of them had committed, etc. The one sister who showed up brought one sheet of paper they deemed inadmissible and then lied right to the judge's face as he asked her questions about things he was reading among our mountain of evidence. I was ecstatic that the judge ruled in our favor and that Eric will be where he belongs and where he wanted to be.

The ceremony was held outside in a lovely garden which opened up to a large field with a hugh white podium decorated so elegantly with white flowers.  The other members of the wedding party did not wear formal wear as did the groom and bride which was a nice contrast.  They instead wore ballerina wear.  The backdrop of the white chairs on the green grass was also very lovely.  It was a very sunny day so the brightly colored umbrellas that were handed out as we entered the garden as a nice touch.  The reason the event was so memorable to me was because it brought together a lot of my other cousins whom I had not seen in many years.   I have very happy to have the opportunity to see one cousin in particular that I had not seen since we were little girls.  I could not believe how much she resembled herself as a girl so there was no problems identifying her at all.  We exchanged cell phone numbers and promised to stay in touch, something I plan to do as we are both getting older every day.  The other main reason my cousin's wedding stood out for me was seeing my elderly aunt, (bride's mother) who is well into her 80's now, attend the event and enjoy the day.  She has had a few health scares and it was really good that she could attend and be a part of the festivities.  I also think it did everyone good to sit outside in the sun while breathing in air freshened by all the foliage that surrounded us.  My cousin usually goes for either very flashy men or men who depend on woman more than they should, however, this time around, she chose someone who stands on his own and who enjoys a simple life being with the one he loves.  We all can see the love they have for each other which made the day that much more enjoyable knowing that finally, she has chosen well as she moves into the middle stage of her life.",3.0,My cousin had a beautiful summer wedding in a local garden on a most beautiful day.

I have about four classes left which is super exciting and just recently I took my latest pre-practicum. It is essentially a face to face test where you test your counseling skills to see if you are competent in those areas.  I did well but it would a bit of a struggle at the beginning. The main reason for the struggle is that I had not done really any practice on my face to face counseling skills.  I did pass the test and it was a fun trip.  The convention of sorts was held in Phoenix Arizona and I drove there which took about four hours.  It was a fun trip as I went with my wife and we stayed in a hotel close to the area were I would be doing my studying and test.  I enjoyed everything about the event for the most part.  I am very excited to get my degree and begin a new adventure into counseling but I am not done yet.  I will have to complete 1000 hours of internship before I can officially be a licensed counselor.  This is a daunting task that I am not looking forward to because they require you to complete 20-30 hours a week.  Although in theory this doesn't seem like much but when you work a full time job 40 hours a week and have other responsibilities throughout the weeks its something that can really have a huge affect on my life.  I know its going to be hard because essentially I will be working 60-70 hours a week.  The other problems is how will I be able to fit those hours into my work schedule.  This is something that I have thought about and I am confident I can do it but it just seems like a lot of things could go wrong.  I will definitely have to be ready to take action and be able to get a decent amount of sleep throughout this time.

She started the first round of chemo on a Monday and we spent 4 hours and 30 minutes in the infusion center. She was sent home with a battery operated pack that pumped chemo into her port 24 hours per day. Two days later (Wednesday) she woke and was very weak and very sick and a bit delusional.

I greeted Rick warmly and he introduced me to everybody.  We were all about the same age and, as I was surprised to see, we all had similar backgrounds.   I also was surprised that none of them wanted to talk shop.  They were there to have fun and get away from their jobs for a while; which is surprising these days.   Despite two women being in the group we talked about Formula One racing, mixed martial arts, how the Dolphins suck.  The conversation even got pretty raunchy, times.  Which I think all guys agree is kind of risky in the #metoo era.  We ate a lot (Asian fusion) and we drank a lot.  I actually drank a little too much and was worrying about the drive home.   The parry lasted for about two hours and when we were done, I was a little shaky.  Rick insisted that I stay in his room for the night because he had a double bed.  I took him up on the offer and after we said good night to the others, instead of going back to the room, we actually went of over to the bar and and had a few more drinks.  Rick and I had not spent too much time together since college; most of our contact had been through texts and social media.  But, it didn't take us long to fall into old habits.  Just like in the old days, one drink led to another.  By the time the bar was closing, both of us were shit faced.  A hotel employee had to help us up to the room.

All white Americans are the descendants of people who immigrated, most over 100 years ago. I like how Andrew Yang wants to give a ""freedom dividend."" This means that every American over 18 will get $1,000 a month ""no strings attached."" Personally I think that with automation and AI (Artificial Intelligence) in the future there are not going to be enough jobs for people. ""If you brought it a trucker brought it."" It is safe to say that soon cars and trucks are going to be self driving. Within a decade your food order and a fast food restaurant will most likely be prepared by a robot. The self checkout lines at Target and Walmart are just the start, pretty robots will be stocking the shelves and running the warehouse. Yes, some high paying tech IT and engineering jobs will be created, but not enough to off set the loss of jobs. However, I LOVE robotics and AI (Artificial Intelligence). Just think of all of the accidents that self driving cars will prevent. Wouldn't it be awesome to relax  on your way to work and let the car drive itself? I favor and agree and lot with moderate Republicans. However, I think that Trump realizes that in the future there will not be enough jobs for the working and middles classes due to AI (Artificial Intelligence). He wants to avoid a situation where Universal Basic Income would need to be implemented. My theory is that he wants to get rid of all of the immigrant workers. He then will install tough work standards for people to get public assistance (Welfare/Food Stamps). Who would pay for Universal Basic Income, $1,000 a month for every American over 18? You need a thousand million to make a billion. To just crack the top 1% for a given year for a couple filling jointly or a single person looking at total income (wages, capital gains, and inheritances) you would need about $469,000 annually. If you are working and middle class please consider Andrew Yang the son of Korean Immigrants for President. You will get $1,000 per month starting at age 18.

Carolyn and I were two of the young people that travelled with my religious group to Chicago. We were always going to Chicago in those days, which was about a 10 hour drive. Carolyn was fifteen and I was nineteen. Her mother always travelled with us. Carolyn was a beauty even in those days but I could not flirt with her with her mother so close. I remember all the times we had to change a tire in those days, since we were always having flats on the drive. She would help me and thus, we could spend some time alone, away from her mother. I think she liked me too but it was too risky to date, since she was still underage. She got married at the age of 18 and I did not see her for many years, since her husband was in the military and they moved a lot. A few years ago, a friend died and I saw her again at the friend's funeral. She was still beautiful but she was also married, this time to her second husband. It was great to see her. Then, last week in my book club, we happened to mention some things and I found out that one of our new members was her ex-husband, who I had never met. We talked a bit about her mother and he told me that Carolyn had two children by him. He didn't mention she had recently died. I only found out about a week later.

This is not our first child but this pregnancy and deliver were definitely some of the most challenging and difficult. My wife had been in and out of the hospital for monitoring over the prior two weeks due to hyper tension and worries of preeclampsia. This last time she was admitted they decided that they needed to keep her for monitoring. While she was having normal contractions it was noted that our babies hear rate would dip dangerously low with each contraction. This, they suspected, was because the umbilical cord was wrapped around the babies neck. The contractions were tightening the cord and cutting off some of her air supply. They decided they needed to induce right away. My wife was trying to push the baby out but was having great difficulty and everything was made even more difficult because of the babies heart rate dropping with every attempt. The doctor was getting frustrated and worried that she would not be able to deliver normally and had them prep the OR for an emergency C-section. My wife was adamant that she didn't want a C-section, but the doctor told her they would have to do what is in her and the babies best interests. He then said she had a few more minutes to try herself, and that she really needed to focus. At this point, my wife really tried and after a couple pushes, and some pulling from the doctor with a suction cup, the babies head was visible. The doctor quickly unwrapped the umbilical cord from around the babies neck and my wife finished the delivery of our little girl.

After enjoying the rainbow for some time I noticed there was a nest build on my window sill. I cannot believe I almost missed this beautiful sight. The mother bird was a rare shade of pink I have never seen before in nature only in the zoo. But the most majestic part of this experience was the eggs that laid peacefully still in the nest. The eggs were the bluest shade of blue I had ever seen before. I never pictured that a pink bird could lay such beautiful blue eggs. The mother bird was always so attentive to the nest and watchful over these eggs. Just before I left for holiday I saw an egg begin to crack. I unfortunately never got to see the birds hatch.

I spent two days searching for her, checking the road, checking the animal shelters, emailing the shelters. I checked the cars to be sure she was not stuck anyplace. I was super upset that she was missing since a different cat had gone missing before only to find out that one of our neighbors must have taken it. This story is about the misadventures of our missing cat. Then I went outside one evening a few days later and Baby Kitty came stumbling out of the garage. She could not stand up at all and her head was tilted to the side. She seemed to be in a lot of distress about not standing up, so I grabbed the cat carrier and off we went to the Emergency Vet, since of course this happened after the normal vets are closed. The emergency vet is not really very close since we live in a rural area, so it took about a half hour of listening to her cry to get there! I was super upset and worried about her since I did not know what was wrong with her. The vet diagnosed her with Idiopathic Vestibular Disease, which is sort of a catch all for a few possible causes, inflammation in the brain, or inner ear infection or a brain tumor. They said the only way to tell if it was a brain tumor was with an MRI, which they don't really recommend as a first step. They suggested trying antibiotics first to see if there was any improvement and hope that it was not a brain tumor! We got antibiotics and came home. Baby Kitty had to spend a week in our bathroom since she could not walk very well and I was concerned she would fall down the stairs! My oldest son had to give her the medicines twice a day while we were on Vacation too, so I was worried about him doing it right. Baby Kitty is doing much better, still a bit wobbly and has a slight head tilt still, so we will have to bring her back to the vet for a follow up. The most memorable event of this whole incident is we still do not know where Baby Kitty was for three days when she was missing. We also don't know if the disease happened because she was stuck someplace or if she got stuck because she lost the ability to walk somehow. This whole incident was super upsetting because the last time we had to go to the Emergency Vet our dog did not make it.",1.0,Our cat Baby Kitty went missing for a few days and when we found her she was unable to stand up.

The materials had completely coated the pavement. Something came over me--I had a feeling of going into autopilot when I saw a man about my age beeline out of the truck to scramble for the debris that had fallen. I biked across the street with the intention of helping him lift the materials back onto his truck. He was overtly grateful to me, and asked that I come to his office later to get compensation for my act. I was hesitant, but he insisted. When I visited his office later, it turned out he was a CEO for a tech startup, and was working on building an app with investor capital. I let him know I was a computer science major, was interested in building an app, and was dissatisfied with my current office job at a call center for an online private education institution. I'd taken a break from school to work at that call center. The environment was very hostile, the office politics brutal, and the work expectations for the expected wages inequitable. In addition I don't have my driver's license yet so I had to bike or take a city bus to get to work--affording relying on Uber/Lyft was out of the question because I sent any part of my paycheck to my mother who was suffering from Crohn's disease and homeless in an extended-stay motel. So I was desperate to find a less hellish opportunity. He convinced me that I'd be a valuable asset to the project, and talked about equity for the app if it was successful. I had no experience with this kind of stuff, but I decided to go for it. I eventually transitioned from working my office job to working for him. I spent the next 4 months building the UI for his app along with 5 interns. I witnessed shocking things I never had seen before with regards to human greed and corporate backstabbing in the software development field. The app didn't get finished, and without warning I was laid off because all of the investors had pulled out. Right before Christmas 2018. I was devastated, and found out the CEO ended up dissolving his company, declared bankruptcy, got divorced, sold all his possessions, and ended up institutionalized. I went through a dark period myself, but with the help of my best friend and my mom (my only family), I gained online employment such that I can fully sustain myself (with a roommate), maintain a 401K, and have decided that I don't want to be a part of the 9-5 work environment if it's going to be so toxic.

Then I was able to get her to get my crutches from the garage. I'm glad I kept those things! Finally I was mobile but far from walking. about 6-8 weeks go by while I'm beginning to master the crutches. I could even use on to push the gas pedal at times because driving was so difficult. Finally the crutches were not need anymore and started my long journey to recovery.  Everything was progressing and healing until I twisted my torso one day rolling over and pulled another muscle that overlaps the first one I tore at the gym. That set me back another 4-6 weeks.

We stayed in a lovely rental house in Rosemary Beach, about an hour from Destin. The drive was not too bad, about five hours from our home, but it was long enough with small children in the car. I was nervous about this trip because it was our first family vacation and I have a hard time managing my two strong-willed children, especially when they are together. Sure enough, by Day 2 I was exhausted. I had to carry my youngest on my hip probably ninety percent of the time, even including when we were at home. He woke up at 5:30 AM every morning, so I was forced to do so as well. We engaged in a variety of activities including souvenir shopping, visiting the community pool, going to the beach, and watching a bottlenose dolphin show at an aquarium. Probably my favorite thing we did was go to a natural spring that wasn't far from where we were staying. The water was a beautiful aquamarine and clear as it could be. The only problem was it was COLD! We had a blast wading and swimming a bit, and just enjoying the beautiful scenery.

I was completely out of breath and exhausted but I wanted to look cool in front of her so I didn't say anything. We got to a point on the hike where the trail was extremely narrow and parallel to a cliff side. Me, wanting to look cool, thought it'd be a good idea to attempt to cross while making a very obvious point not to use my hands to hold onto the wall next to the path. Obviously this had the negative effect you would have imagined, and I slipped. I was dangling off the edge of the drop. It wasn't a very big drop, probably like 8 or 10 feet, but definitely high enough that I would have probably broken an ankle if I wasn't prepared. My wife screamed and started panicking which made it quite difficult to concentrate on getting back up the ledge. Luckily I was able to shuffle over to where she was frantically panicking. I reached my arm out for her to help me up and almost took her down with me. After almost pulling her down with me, she managed to pull me back up onto the cliff with her.

Quite a few of my colleagues and friends are envious that my son and I spent so much time together. Many of my coworkers are younger and have moved as far away from their parents as possible and are a bit baffled that my family is a close one. During the vacation I had gathered a number of brochures and collectibles from each Walt Disney World park (Epcot, Animal Kingdom, Magic Kingdom, etc.), and plan to put together a scrapbook album to commemorate the vacation. During the week long trip with my son we participated in what are referred to as 'magic shots' in the Disney parks. A cast member/photographer takes special photographs and can place an animated character in the photo. The most enjoyable and surprising magic shot was standing in front of the Haunted Mansion posing as hitchhiker's. We didn't realize the photographer was adding our favorite ghost to tag along with us! She was paying attention to my son as he described childhood memories in Disneyland and which ghost always caught his eye. I am looking forward to printing more photos and relive the memories. Our state fair has a scrapbook competition, and while I am not an avid 'scrap book maker' I do have a number of photo albums. Utahan's in general are fans of Disney. This year at the fair I saw other competitors and regretted not having mine done in time since I felt my abilities were comparable. The experience certainly motivated me to finish the album long before the fair next year.

I first became a Christian when I was eleven years old. It was honestly a traumatic experience for me because I was raised in churches that were, to be bluntly and brutally honest, cruel to my family and me. My parents were ostracized for many, many things, including the fact that my dad had an old navy tattoo and my mom homeschooled us. Were were basically the poster children for teasing and humiliation. As I grew older, my perception of God grew more and more confused. In fact, I developed a true and utter terror of God and Jesus. Churches pounded hell, fire, and brimstone, so I just turned myself over to serve God out of terror. When I became a Christian, I broke because I felt that I was still sinning or forgetting to read my Bible sometimes, or losing my temper. I felt that I needed to be rebaptized since I didn't read my Bible all the time due to forgetting, or the fact that I was going through puberty and would sometimes lash out at my family. I now know that I have PCOS and PMDD, so that explains a lot, but my old self thought I was clearly unregenerate and worthy of hell even in my saved state. I would pray the ""sinner's prayer"" every night out of fear that I wasn't living perfectly enough and, should I die, I would burn in hell. I eventually felt that I lost my faith. After losing my grandmother, my faith in God dwindled away, piece by piece, because I was angry that an all-powerful God could let this horrible thing--this death-- continue when He had the power to stop it. I was going to a very modern church, and I felt even more disconnected because the church never spoke of much of anything except ""self help."" I felt like I had to leave there, but I was afraid. So I began tearing up the Bible and deep theology, determined to understand God in ways that I never had before. I read words of wisdom from the Bible and great Biblical scholars like Swindoll, McGarthur, J.C. Ryle...I couldn't sleep at night, because, as I was digging deeper, I realized that I never truly understood the Bible until then. Never. I would sleep little, spending late, late hours of the night in study and prayer. It was life-changing because, out of this ""metamorphosis,"" I began to truly connect to God and understand our purpose on this earth. I understood the plan--why Jesus had to die, why His timing for ending the world is perfect, and why we shouldn't fear death if we put our faith in Him. It all began to make sense -- the meaning of baptism, the reason we struggle with sin...God is our advocate to walk with us through it all. We don't have to be perfect -- we strive, we pray, and we constantly crave a deeper connection to our God. It changed me, and I am walking the path to re-baptism because I truly love God and His plan for our lives.",2.0,This is a testimony of my true conversion at thirty-one years of age.

I got excited because that meant there might be decent fishing. We finish our hike (looping back to this bridge again) by mid afternoon. I get my stuff out and rigged up and start tossing bugs. Every offering, this fish beneath the bridge would short strike but never take. I switched to an ant and had my son grab it and let go. I figured it was time to let him cool down because I thought I could catch him on that pattern, but he had seen it too much to take it at that point. I went downstream, fishing the seams and holes I could find. As I walked downstream surrounded by these sequoias 40 feet around, I came to this pool at the end of a run. It looked fishy. You know what feeling when you're fishing new water but you get to a spot and laugh to yourself that if there's no fish in there you might as well pack it up now? It was that king of spot. I toss out my ant pattern from before, right at the bottom of the run before it opens up into a slow slow drift over a hole that was at least three times deeper than any hole I had seen up to that point. I look down to manage my line and prepare for a couple of mends to get that fly to drift perfectly through that hole. When I looked up I saw the silhouette of what would be considered Jaws in this tiny stream. He was nearly at my fly and then he pounded that thing. Not some measly sip. This big boy knew how to eat. I got a great hookset and it was game on. Within the first ten seconds this fish had launched itself two full body-lengths out of the water three times. It was an absolute rocket. It had all the room in the world to swim down because the pool was so deep, and then launch itself straight out of the water like it was straight out of Cape Canaveral.

At the end of my lessons I usually chat a bit with my teacher, as it's difficult to fill up an entire half hour lesson with nothing but teachings about guitar and going over scales and such. During each lesson he gets me to play through whatever song or scale or technique he had been teaching me the week (or multiple weeks) earlier. This particular lesson while we were talking he paused for a moment and brought up that he'd noticed I was really struggling to learn a particular song, and that it had been ""beating me up"" for several weeks as I was attempting to learn it. I had been practicing the song a lot but I wasn't getting much better at it despite my best efforts, and I was concerned that it appeared to him that I wasn't actually practicing it enough due to my abilities not improving much over time. He remarked that he admired the fact that I was determined enough to keep sticking with it and carrying on despite how challenging it was for me to learn the song. He also told me that as he was old enough to be my father, he felt it was appropriate to tell me that he was very proud of me with how far I had come with learning guitar, and that he has many students who drop out after only a few months of taking lessons. I thanked him and was left a little bit speechless by his words, it was unexpected and it meant a lot to me that he was really seeing my progress over time - especially when I was worried because I myself wasn't seeing much of my own improvements. As I was leaving at the end of the lesson he reminded me to keep working at it and that I would eventually be able to play it, it would just take time. His comments renewed my desire to learn the song and I was motivated to continue learning it over the next few weeks. I got to a point where I was able to play it with minimal mistakes and better timing than before. I was quite touched by it because not many people are so genuine and open with their thoughts or compliments about others, and I don't often receive praise like that in my everyday life. It can be frustrating taking up a new hobby, especially if you're not good at it and to hear recognition that you're doing well and still progressing can alleviate some insecurities about your lack of ability. It can also motivate you more to keep pursuing it even if it is difficult.

While my mother was paying/in-line and I was just waiting for her, I came across/walked right beside this old woman with the unusual attire (sort of like a flashy/unusual blouse; her hair done in an upright/spiky-esque way; colored pants; some ornaments on her shoulders and etc.). I remember reaching out for something near the woman (not on purpose) and me grabbing something that interested me, but then I had dropped it. The old woman right away bent down and picked it up for me. I thought nothing of it, but just thanked her and she continued to walk past me. Soon after she turned back and started engaging in conversation with me. She did speak mostly Spanish, but when realizing I didn't know much of it, she changed to English and could speak it somewhat well. I remember this experience with her to have somewhat of a ""feel"" of ""ambiance"" to it with her. I felt pretty much in an odd but not uncomfortable situation when conversing with her.

She then walked off and I then proceeded to leave with my mother, talking briefly about the experience/exchange with the woman. While I didn't talk about it once or feel it to be particularly special at the time, I kind of felt that it was pretty unique and interesting how we conversed back and forth (the woman was pretty calm and understanding -- not hesitant or in a rush or anything and basically very casual/comfortable speaking and such). I soon thought back to the event and that somehow made it feel more unique as some time had passed. Basically, the idea from this experience was that it was special in both the unusual attire of the woman -- and in her absolute kindness/peace/exchange experience with her. She was very different in her mannerisms than others and that's what struck out to me more than anything, but it was all enveloped in a package deal of just memorability and uniqueness.",1.0,I went to a local store with my mother and noticed an unusual attired old woman walking around.

We bought the tickets last year about 7 or 8 months ago so for it to finally get here was different. It was even better because two of the friends going i did not get to see often and one had recently moved away. SO we piled 5 people 4 people into my friends car and started the 7 hour drive to dallas. The drive was awful it was hot outside but the company made it not so bad really. We stopped at Bucees and took in the great texas culture getting gas buying food and other things and eventually arrived at our AirBnB. We were the first there and quickly all made sure to choose a room with a single bed in it. Then the others arrived from their flights and it was great and so nice to just see everyone there again and say hi exchange pleasantry's etc. From there we went to the convention center on the first day and stood in a long check in line that made us all want to drive home. But after that it was great seeig all the booths meeting new people relaxing really made it feel like a vacation. That night we all hung out played a drinking game ordered food and really relaxed. Waking up late the next day was expected as we had a bit too much to drink but me and another friend took an uber and went and got some breakfast. The dennys was packed but the pancakes were great. The next day was just as good as the first but without the long checkin lineso we spent the day at the convention center and then went for some food at lunch. We ate  at this great wing restauraunt and had a great time then headed back before going home. That night we found out it was one of our friends birthday so we bought a cake and all sang happy birthday. We hung out at the house played some games and watched movies while having some drinks. Going forward to the last day two friends had to go home but the rest of us spent the day together relaxing and repeating all the last days. Fast forward to monday and it is time for us to head home. The drive was awful but we all had a lot of fun and lying in bed that night i was glad for the great weekend.,1.0,Me and  five friends went to dallas for a convention and stayed at an air bnb in the area.

It was like any other day at work. We had already spent 8 hours that day preparing and loading everything we needed for the event that night, at a hotel in downtown Dallas, and I remember that afternoon being hot, as usual, but the traffic was unusually heavy. We were in a moving truck, but this one was a rental that none of us had ever used. We arrived about 45 minutes later, through the traffic and construction, to downtown Dallas, and all three of the truck docks were taken, nothing new there. If we didn't arrive half an hour before our load-in time, it was bound to happen, so I convinced a security guard to let us use a side-dock on a street they normally didn't use. The dock was adjacent to a street that was on an incline, and we had about 5 hours to unload everything, move it into place, clean it, and get out before people started pouring in. A few hours passed, so far so good. Then we got to the walls. Our company makes these pre-fab walls that we set-up, drill together and weigh-down with sandbags, and I had installed these a thousand times. My co-worker and I started rolling the cart loaded with about 1,500 lbs of walls to the liftgate, and we accounted for the slope, very cautious as usual. I was between the cart of walls and the street as my co-worker started to lower the liftgate, and as the liftgate reached the ground and I was about to roll the cart off, I felt the cart start to tip. The next thing I knew, everything was on top of me and I felt a sudden flash of pain and adrenaline. I thought I was dead. In what seemed like just a second, the cart tipped over on me, knocked me back, and was lifted off by two of my co-workers. The liftgate on the rental truck we decided to use for the evening had and extra little incline on the end, and paired with incline of the hill we decided to unload on, the extra little five inches of ramp sent the cart over the tipping point. I couldn't move my foot. I looked down and saw it laying unnaturally flat against the pavement and I later found out that the cart had dislocated my foot from my leg and broken two bones. It seemed like forever before the ambulance arrived. All I could think about was my girlfirend since we had a baby on the way and I was the only one working. How would we pay the bills? When the paramedics finally arrived, I was taken to the hospital, and ended up enduring the most excruatiating night of my life. As they set my foot back into place, I was in tears, and even though heavily medicated, could feel it all. I ended up needing three surgeries, complete with metal pins, a giant foot brace, and crutches. The doctors told me I wouldn't be able to walk for at least a year, and that I will probably never fully be able to work again, at least not physical labor.",3.0,"While working downtown, I broke and dislocated my ankle in two places, and was transported to the hospital.",120.0

I was really sad about a friend I had, because she said she was moving away the day that school ended. I was so distraught I couldn't bring myself to say anything to her, since it was too painful for me to remember how I would never see her again. I ended up bolting out of my last class and heading to the local market, where I bought a maple bar and coffee. Maple bars and coffee ended up being a ritual of sorts for me after that day. I bought a 20 dollar store card at that same market and redeemed it for a video game, which I played for an hour before breaking down in tears. I wished at the time things were different, that I didn't have her leave my life. I was certain, at least at the time, that I had met someone very special to me. Fast forward a couple of years, and I no longer speak to her. Part of me wishes that I kept in touch, but I realize now that people have to move one. No matter how painful or uncomfortable it may be.

I remember going to work that day from camp, putting him on his lead so he could hang out outside, enjoying the sunshine on my walk.  I took lunch early that day for some reason, and when I got back home he was still outside.  As I approached he seemed fine (if a little quiet), but when I made it to him...His right eye was swollen shut and was tender to the touch.  He would barely let me look at at it, which is especially odd for him.  He kept scratching it with his paw as though there was an itch he just couldn't get to, and the swelling was spreading a bit down his face and snout.  He was obviously in pain, and I had no idea what or how or when; all I knew was that my boyfriend, whose dog he is, was out for the next 3 days on a wilderness excursion with no contact and suddenly I was in charge. The next two days were awful.  He got Benedryl at first, but when that didn't do anything the vet came out to see him.  Somehow, he had managed to poke a hole in his cornea and if things went wrong he would go blind in that eye.  When I heard that, I didn't know what to do-- how do I break that to my partner?!  How did he manage to poke a hole in his cornea while by himself?!  It's not like that's something that 'just accidentally' happens all the time. He ended up in a cone for weeks, and had to take multiple medications-- one of which had to go in his swollen-shut eye.  He wasn't allowed to be outside alone anymore and had to go to a friend's house every day before work.  Because of his injury and the resulting cone, he was lethargic and not eating very much, which was compounded by the fact that my partner was still not home or able to be contacted. It ultimately worked out, and the dog did not lose his eye.  My partner came home and I saw him run through every emotion I had had for the last few days in minutes as I brought him up to speed.

This was a big deal  in my life. I had previously struggled to find an affordable place to live while I am in the process of saving money to pay off debts. I had just moved the previous year into a new home with a close friend, and having a roommate was saving me roughly $100/mo versus my expenses living alone in the smaller apartment I moved from. Unfortunately, after only living together a few months, my roommate, who was only 19 at the time, decided he wasn't ready to live on his own, and opted to move back in with his parents. His parents took him back without any problems, but this left me in the unfortunate position of not having the money to cover all of the expenses associated with moving, but also not earning enough every month to cover my expenses living in the 2-bedroom apartment alone. At first, I struggled to find a new roommate, but I was living in a rural location that was not very enticing to any of my similarly-aged single friends, who seek to live in an urban environment with nightlife. I then negotiated with my landlord for slightly cheaper rent in exchange for maintaining the property for him. I did things like mowing the grass and cleaning the other units in preparation for new tenants, and he took $100/mo off of my rent. This helped, but it didn't leave me any free time because I was constantly working or doing side jobs to earn extra income, taking care of the large property by myself, or cleaning my own large apartment. However, just a few months ago, a good friend of mine told me that he had a small house which he had been renting, but he was now preparing to sell. He thought it would be beneficial for me to have a cheap place to live, and it would be beneficial to him if he could sell the home to someone who would maintain it as a rental property. He allowed me to move in at a rental rate that was $200/mo cheaper than my current rate including my $100/mo discount. In addition, he waived the security deposit so that I could move in immediately. When he sold the home, I locked in my low rent with the new owner indefinitely with a year-to-year lease that automatically renews. I also pay less for utilities such as electricity because the home is smaller, and the internet providers here are cheaper than they were in my old apartment. Overall this has left hundreds more dollars in my pocket every month which I am now being able to use to dig myself out of debt faster.",1.0,"I used to live in a really expensive place, and had no free time because I was always working.

I have known a child that was abused in a different manner, and that is the only way I can identify with this story. Personally, however, I do not identify with it much, if at all.","When I was eight years old, about 22 months ago, my dad started to hit me. The most memorable part of this is the way he acted after the abuse each time. He would apologize like he had done something minor, like forgetting to read me a bedtime story. He just acted like what happened was something that he could apologize and move on from. I will never forget the way he dismissed his own behavior. However, his behavior ended up ruining mine and my siblings' lives. I fear that if I ever see him again or that if he has more children in the future, the abuse will continue once more. I hope that he does not remarry a woman that has children of her own as well. I fear that if he becomes involved with a wife or other children, he will abuse them as well. The abuse has been significant to my life because it has led to a chain of events that have landed me in foster care. After a teacher noticed the bruises, she told officials. Officials investigated the situation of my home life and immediately determined that I was not safe at home with my father. Since my mother is not in the picture, I was placed immediately into foster care. This did not only affect me, however. My siblings were abused and place into foster care as well. We were placed with different foster families and I have not seen my sibling since. I miss my siblings, and as much as my home was an unhappy place, I miss having a home to call my own. I feel that I have no one in the world that truly knows me or that I can depend on. I just feel very alone. It is hard for me to talk about anyone about this since it is a very personal experience that only a few other that have been through it can understand. It helps a little bit to write out my feelings in this diary, but it is not the same as talking to a trusted person that understands how I feel. The actions of my father have changed my life for the worse. I have lost my family and my home. I do not feel safe anymore since he started abusing me and my siblings.

Just when i thought this free nature show couldn't get any better a second lynx walked out from the woods and began a mating call with the first lynx.  I listened to them and watched them walk the bank for what seemed like and hour.  I have never seen anything so great and beautiful from nature and probably never will.

I moved from my parents house and packed up all my belongings over the course of a week or so, then my girlfriend drove down from Northern Maine(I lived in Mass). We loaded up her car and mine, and began the 7 hour drive to our new place. After several weeks of preparation, organizing everything and getting stuff set up and purchased how we would need them, we were finally ready for this huge transition. In the coming weeks after that long drive, we unpacked everything and set up our new place how we wanted it. There was a lot of frustration and sweat and swearing as we struggled to shift furniture around the apartment, but we managed. Then some weeks later, I managed to find a job in a medical office. A position I took to readily and have since been excelling at. The actual act of moving was a stressful one, we spent a lot of time worrying ourselves over money, over my ability to find a job, over how I""d manage to work out my schooling, all of it. Not to mention the fact that my family strongly disapproved of the decision and began treating me incredibly poorly once I broke the news to them. We drove for several hours before making our first stop, me trailing behind her, as her car was larger and she had packed it up to the point where she couldn't really see behind her. We stopped to pick up something to drink and use the restroom, as well as refuel our cars. THe drive was one we'd made many times before so the actual act of driving wasn't too bad, however, it was somewhat exhausting for her since she made the drive down just the day prior. With the cars refueled we went a ways further, before stopping for some Burger King. The rest of the trip was pretty uneventful, and we stopped first at our new apartment to drop off some of the stuff. However, since we got in at around 10pm, we were too tired to really move everything in in earnest, so we went to her parent's house to sleep.

The trip consisted of five friends and myself. Most of us live in Florida, so we departed from Miami and had stops in Key West, Mexico and Belize before returning home. The reason we decided to do the trip was it had been 10 years since we graduated from college and went on a graduation cruise together. While taking that first trip, we made a pact to take a cruise every decade to reconnect and have fun together. Our work and personal lives have made it hard to see one another that often, but we managed to coordinate our schedules to take this trip. I roomed with one friend on the ship, while the other four had a larger cabin that they all shared with one another. Each day, we had a different activity to do. On our two days at sea, we went to the pool and the casino during the day, while enjoying some adult beverages. While we were in Key West, we walked around the town and visited local restaurants and bars. In Mexico, we were only there for a few hours due to inclement weather, but managed to do some duty-free shopping. And while we were in Belize, we got a taxi and went to a local beach and tavern to enjoy the natural beauty of that country. During the evening, we had our own table in the ship’s dining room and then would go to one of the shows that the ship had and then to a bar or club onboard. There was plenty of time for all of us to reconnect with one another, reminisce about when we were younger, and have fun. On our last night, it was hard to believe how fast the trip went and how many of us won’t get to see one another for a long period of time. There were a few misty eyes, but we pledged to do this trip again in 10 years and to keep better in touch with one another in the interim. Since then, we regularly text one another and share social media posts. I have been able to grab a bite to eat with two of them recently, while they were in town for the day. This trip reminds me how fast time can fly and how important it is to maintain friendships over the years. It can be hard to make the time, but it is well worth it.",4.0,"Fulfilling a pledge made after we graduated college, 5 friends and I took a cruise 10 years after we took our first one.

I won't repeat any of it here because it could be pretty offensive. We watched fireworks well into the night and I ended up getting drunk for the first time in about 15 years.

So all the work I did all semester was not important, all that mattered was these tests. So I stayed up each night this week studying, stressing and preparing the best I could to take my final exams. By the third day, I was so exhausted getting out of bed, I think I blacked out. I ended up falling out of my bed and I don't even think I was conscious at this point. I fell right onto my arm and sustained a painful hematoma. My roommate came running in and couldn't believe what she saw. She urged me to go to the hospital. I tried to brush it off and go back to sleep but the pain was too much so I agreed to go to the hospital. I sat in the emergency room for 90 minutes before being seen by a doctor and they admitted me to the hospital right away. Apparently the injury wasn't urgent enough to get to me right away but was severe enough to admit me to the hospital. I saw many doctors and even a specialist. They preformed a multitude of tests from X-rays, blood work, and a CAT scan to make sure I didn't have any other injuries. The doctors told me that I would need surgery and I was devasted. Not only did I not want to undergo surgery, what about my exams? The pain and stress were so much to handle and I burst into tears. After discussing surgery and options with a few doctors, the attending physician decided it wasn't necessary and he could treat the injury without surgery.  I was relieved and was released from the hospital the next day, just in time to take my exams. Lucky for me, my professor was understanding and let me complete them during make up time frame so I had more time to study.

Cliche as it sounds and as over dramatic as I may come off as, I'd have to say it meant the world to me to finally meet somebody with a head on their shoulders and who isn't a completely horrible person. Well, let me clarify that not everyone is that, but my prior relationships in both instances were enough to turn me off of the very thought of another for a lifetime. Between mental abuse, lies, manipulation and cheating, I somehow managed to hit the jackpot back to back, in the worst of ways. I won't go into details about that, simply to save everyone the displeasure of a history lesson and a guy who couldn't see similar signs from two different people, but instead finally go into details about this next one. Through a neutral friend we ended up meeting one another and neither really had any wants or desires for a relationship. We started out as friends, we'd bullshit around and usually did things with the group. Although we both had some unique, silly tastes that the entire group hadn't enjoyed (But parts did). Anyways, as time passed and we continued to learn from one another that we enjoyed quite a bit together, we decided to do more things on a one on one basis, without so many people around. Recently though this came to a head as we finally realized what we were doing and came to talk about it. She was a veteran, with obvious problems from her time serving, along with a horrible ex-husband and failures afterwards. Obviously what she endured had been worse than mine, but it's ultimately not a competition. We shared more intimate things and our reasoning for backing off when it came to a full on commitment. It was probably there that it should have been finalized, one way or the other but instead we just thanked each other for listening, understanding and continued to do our things together. Then, finally, one night we had both finally had enough and began to moan, complain and so on about how the other couldn't make the first move, or how things were obvious and we were both being dumb. Just people complaining for the sake of it and to get it off their chests. After that we finally shut one another up and decided to go for it. That was roughly three months ago and things have been incredible. Really the first relationship I feel comfortable in and am not staying around for out of guilt or manipulation.

However, I received a message on the job website--a response to my application, and a request to interview right away. I was taken aback, not expecting something so soon and so relatively informal. The interview was to be done on Google Hangouts, as soon as possible. This sounded strange, but the position was fairly small and low-skilled, but certainly better than nothing. I made coffee and psyched myself up. As I came back to the site, I received more messages from the person--impatient and passive-aggressive in tone, admonishing me for taken long to reply. I apologized, and did my best to get in touch with their people and set-up the interview. I received some interruptions from my grandfather, who was going through a tough time, and I helped him as best I could, as quickly as I could, and apologized to the person. They continued to push me along in a brusque manner, but I was grateful for the opportunity. I began the interview, and for the most part, things went off without a hitch. While I could've used more occupational experience in some of the job's aspects, I was otherwise qualified. However, I noticed that the person's grammar was somewhat odd.

It was a horrifying experience and had we been on the other side of the divider, we could have potentially lost our lives. My partner continued to drive off because he felt like there was no stopping there. There were no lights and the risk of oncoming traffic was a lot scarier than the idea of continuing on.

My shoulders, neck and back were in so much pain that I barely got out of bed. Later that night of the following day, I coughed up some blood.

Today, I am much more careful and aware of what is going on when on the road. If my partner is tired, I tell him to get some rest before we do anything. I feel so lucky to be alive and reflect on it often. It definitely made me appreciate my life a little more, especially when the mechanic was so surprised to see the car's condition and then us. I also discovered tired driving can be worse than drunk driving. Even if you aren't under the influence, tiredness impairs you. It's important to not be ignorant when behind the wheel.

I finally got tired of it and asked for a divorce.  Unfortunately, we have two kids together and we thought it would be in their best interest if the children remained with him, so now I will see my kids far less often. I've not been happy for more than a few years now and I continually tried to bring up that I was unhappy and the exact reasons as to WHY I was unhappy he would basically tell me that he was going to change or fix it but it would never come to pass, or if he DID attempt to make it better it would only last a few days before reverting back to the exact same patterns and behaviors that made me unhappy.  He'd promised to get a job for years, but never made the effort, yet at the same time he didn't want ME to get a job either because he wanted to be the man of the house and be the provider.  I'd had that same conversation with him over and over again over the course of our marriage and that was only one reason that led to my decision to divorce him. This all finally came to a head when he asked me what we were doing.  He was upset that I had been spending more and more time in front of the computer actually attempting to work and actually making money and it was only during THIS conversation that he FINALLY raised the issues he'd been having with me.  Issues that had been going on for some time but just had never seen fit to actually tell me before then even though I would specifically ask if he had any issues with me, anything that I could change every time I tried to bring up the issue that I was unhappy and the exact reasons WHY I was unhappy.

He eventually said that he would try and start telling me things, the good and the bad, but by that point I was just done.

We knew that Jeff has always had a deep interest in airplanes since he always tells us how he wants to be a pilot when he grows up, and Todd really enjoys being lazy on the beach. After my wife and I took off work for a couple weeks during the month of July (before the boy's birthdays), we both thought it would be a great idea to make this whole trip a complete surprise. We planned to travel to a beach for Todd's sake and that it be far away enough from home so that we'd be able to board an airplane for Jeff's sake. So, after endlessly searching for the best prices and deals for airline tickets and hotel rooms, we finally landed (no pun intended) on really cheap tickets that were about $350 each round trip with a hotel room included in the package deal. My wife and I were very excited to reveal the plans to our kids when their birthday came around, but at that point in time, we were just hoping that neither of us ""spilled the beans"". Two weeks later, it finally was time to reveal the big secret. As soon as Jeff and Todd woke up in the morning, we happily wished them both a happy birthday. After seeing the loving smiles on their faces my wife and I knew it was time to make their day even better. This was the most memorable moment that I could remember, when we told the boys about the trip we had planned they both leaped out of bed and hugged each other and yelled out of excitement. Neither of the boys had been on an airplane before so this was going to be a brand new experience for them. Seeing them so overwhelmed with joy brought so much love to my heart that day. I also remember the way that the kids packed up their suitcases the day before we left for vacation, it was surely a sight to see. They were so full of energy that they piled all of their clothes and toys mindlessly in one large heap in the middle of the suitcase, they wanted to leave as soon as possible no matter how disorganized they were!

I have to admit, I enjoyed it at first, finally free of the deadlines, but without the friends and life I’d built in college, all the fun things I wished I could do with my free time just weren’t around to enjoy anymore. This past week has been so hard. I hardly bothered to leave my room much less the house.  But you know what, just when I felt like I needed to resign to this being my life, days of reminiscing for college, I got a call!  Last night, I got an interview for a job at my top choice of firms.

As it is usually just my son and I home we have things down to a 't' when it comes to our schedule but his grandma was home which messed things up a bit. Not only for him but for me too. She's a lot harder to entertain versus a 10 month old. But I had let her take him in with her and she was making her bed. This bed is a good 4 feet off the ground mind you. She decided to put him on top of it and when she was on the other side my poor baby had fallen off. So of course I rush in with my heart beating out of my chest because he was crying so bad. She was trying to explain but I didn't want to hear none of it, I just wanted my baby to be okay. I eventually got him calm and he went to sleep but when he woke and started back in on crying again I knew something wasn't right. I was so angry at her for hurting him though she didn't intentionally hurt him. I still blamed her because I thought how could you not be more careful? You know your bed is a mountain compared to this baby, you know he moves fast! How, how, how did you not think that this would have happened before it did. So we took him to the doctors and this poor little 10 month old is already in to get x-rays. I was devastated, embarrassed and so, so sorry for my little guy. Turns out he got a small fracture to the wrist. So they put a cast on him for 3 weeks and they said the bone will be stronger than it was before since he is so young. It was reassuring but it sure didn't make me feel any better about the situation. Yeah, last week sucked.",3.0,Last week was one of the roughest ones of my life.

My sister was 7 months pregnant, not time to have her baby yet so we didn't think anything of it. We were playing some video games on their old school NES system when my sister thought she had to use the bathroom. When she came out of the bathroom she said there was a little blood. She didn't need to poop - she was in labor!! We timed her contractions and within an hour it was time to go to the hospital. It was really scary and fast. Both of her previous pregnancies were induced so we were shocked. I downloaded an app on my phone and it told me when to go to the hospital. Since my car was blocking my brother in law's we hopped in my jeep and I drove everyone to the hospital. We went to the labor and delivery area where she was immediately checked in and admitted. I got to be in the room when the baby was delivered. It was an amazing experience. I had never seen a baby being born before and the fact that I got to see my niece be born made me so happy and emotional. It's an experience I will never ever forget.

Next stop was Amsterdam we had the opportunity to visit the Heineken brewery and a couple of museums while we made a brief stop here in this city. The city was beautiful and I really like the bike culture there. The absolute highlight of the trip was when we were in Switzerland. I have to say that this was the most memorable country during the whole trip. We went on a 5 hour hike to the longest pedestrian bridge. The journey to the bridge was hard but definity worth it. We got to see a couple of wild animals in the mountain and the most memorable moment was the jaw dropping views of the mountain with the clear blue skies. The food was kind of pricey but was worth every penny. The city and town we stayed in was super clean and the lake was crystal clear.

My son (Jason) and Sarah, with their two little girls, live in an adjacent state, about a 5 hour drive. They scheduled a weekend visit to our home, which just happened to fall on Sarah's birthday. It wasn't a ""significant"" birthday, number wise, but I decided it would be fun to make an actual family party out of it. I figured mostly our two grand-daughters would find that entertaining. So, something I haven't done before, I bought birthday decorations (including a Happy Birthday banner, streamers, and hanging paper globes). I'm not an avid cook (but I do just fine when I need to) but I made a very special birthday dinner, complete with fancy drinks and apps. And, I bought a very elegant birthday cake from a local bakery, complete with candles to blow out. I also used a special tablecloth and had birthday plates and cups for our dessert. I told Ryan to take the family on a walk around the neighborhood so my husband and I could decorate. When they came home 1/2 hour later, Sarah (and the 2 girls) were very surprised and excited to see the decorations. Sarah even got a little teary-eyed and said she couldn't remember the last time she had a ""traditional"" birthday party. Everyone loved the food and commented how exceptional it was. The cake (and ice cream) dessert was also a huge hit. However, the best consequence was the laughter and fun and intimate conversation  that ensued between all of us and lasted well into the late evening. Although I have always had a good relationship with my daughter-in-law, I think she was really touched that I would go to so much work to do a really fun, kid-type birthday party for her.

My uncle had not been well for years and she served as his caretaker the whole time, but always seemed so gracious to have each day with him that she did. It was a day of so many emotions - relief that my uncle would no longer be suffering in a body that no longer served him, but complete grief and selfishness in hopes that he would bear it for longer so we wouldn't have to say goodbye.

It was quite embarrassing and afterwards I felt like I should've known better. My baby sister was about seven months pregnant and had changed the name of her gestating child from the one she'd originally chosen. She and her boyfriend had at first settled on Liam Michael. Liam was a name she'd been set on since teenage years and Michael is our brothers middle name. Suddenly they'd changed the name to Tucker Finn. Those who heard the name including myself, my boyfriend and my brother all privately laughed. Everyone thought it wasn't a great name because it rhymes with many unpleasant words, such as sucker and another word starting with ""F"". All we could think is of how that poor child would get teased mercilessly by his peers. Al three of us became increasingly uncomfortable about how everyone in the family privately snickered but nobody, includng us had spoken up. It felt rude for everyone to be almost sharing a private joke at my sister's expense. We began to surmise that maybe it was her boyfriend who'd initiated the name change or that maybe they just had not thought further about the name. So of course, I was elected to gently inquire,being the closes to my sister.  I thought was the right thing to do and both my brother and boyfriend urged me to. I finally asked her gently as possible why they changed the name. I said ""Tucker is okay but Liam was great and you'd wanted it for so long"". Well, she explained that they'd decided Liam was overused. She stated that she found my inquiry rude. I apologized profusely and said I'd meant no harm, I just wanted to be sure it was what she wanted. She accepted but was obviously not cheerful. Later, feeling ashamed, I googled etiquiette on baby names and realized I should've kept my thoughts to myself. The next day I apologized again and she accepted again, but was quite annoyed because after our conversation her boyfriend told her he didnt like the name Tucker Finn. Suprisingly my boyfriend, brother and I had been right that one of the pair didn't like the name but it was not the one we'd expected.

I keep having to be reminded of that the hard way.  Most recently was about three months ago. Instead of going to get my pickup truck registration renewed on time or, heaven forbid, early, I dawdled around until the last minute and then managed to FORGET the deadline entirely! End result: my sad truck failed to pass the required emissions test. No big deal, right? Not unless I want to drive the truck anywhere.

After about 50 phones calls to every friend and FOF (friend of friend) in very high (and a few low) places, I learned quite a lot about emission testing. For starters, new catalytic converters are crazy expensive. Second, you can hack almost anything with the right know-how and equipment ( which almost always includes aluminum foil). It pays to have friends who know stuff. They don't go out of their way to tell you but if you fail, you get one do-over, for FREE! Provided you can find a repair shop that offers one. That involves looking for a teeny-tiny official-looking sticker in the corner of an often very dirty window. So once you find this mechanical get-out-of jail-free card, you still have to pass the test. That's where friends who know stuff come in. The same three things kept coming up:  tires, oil, cold air. That's the ingredients to the motoring magic elixir: Make sure you have your tires at the proper pressure: make sure you have fresh, clean oil: go when they first open so your car is warm and the air temperature is cooler. The hotter the day, the more chance of coughing out some of the bad stuff. Armed with my new oil and freshly-fluffed tires, I was waiting at the bay door when the service center opened for the day. Fifteen easy-peasy minutes later I was motoring on my way to the license bureau with my A-plus grade emission sticker in hand.

At the start of the session, I admit I was skeptical. The only reason I was doing it is because it was gifted to me; it wasn't something I would have sought out myself. While I've always been a person who believe in spirits and energy living beyond death, someone actually communicating in real time with someone I'd lost was not something I fully believed in. I have to admit that going into the session, my expectations were fairly low. However, it didn't take more than 10 minutes for my entire outlook to change. After telling the medium who it was I wanted to speak to, they kicked off the process to communicate with them. Without going into too much detail, I can say that within the first few minutes of the conversation, I was sure I was speaking to my friend. One thing that the medium said caused me to burst into tears—my friend knew of the symbol we had created for her after her death. I was also finally given some sort of confirmation that my friend was happier where she was. She said that I didn't need to worry about her, and I was told that she spends time with me sometimes.

About a month ago he called me in the middle of the night and told me that he was planning on taking his own life.

Although I was surrounded by a caring family, tragedy struck when I lots my mother at the age of three. I imagine being born into a family of three other siblings , including my twin brother, offered some comfort to this lost.  The ages of my brothers and sisters ranged from fifteen, thirteen and three. This created many challenges for my surviving parent, whose work commitments kept him away from home, often at night. It was decided that my twin brother and I would be split between relatives to relieve the stress created by my mothers absence. This, however difficult it is to imagine created for me a unique growing experience splitting my time between the city and the country. As I reflect on my situation growing up in this environment I realize that it offered me unique benefits, perhaps not experienced by other children growing up in more traditional arrangements. I have always had an outgoing personality and friendliness, generally attributed to a level of patience and flexibility in most social interactions I have with people, personally and professionally. This trait I know comes from leaning at an early age to adapt to change that comes unexpectedly. When my father re-married, I was ten and fell back on my experiences as a younger child to better adapt to yet another chapter in my family dynamic to unfold. Although, at this time I do remember some typical Pre-teen angst, that proved challenging for my father and step mother, my history proved yet again that patience and flexibility rewarded me with a loving and committed new mother whose example of strength and courage played a very important role in my formative years. I often think just how blessed I am to have had 2 mothers, a twin brother and such a loving and unique family dynamic growing up. The most endearing and lasting memories I have are of a transitional nature and not necessarily stability.

She was in the middle of her treatments, going for radiation and chemo, her hair was starting to fall out and she shaved her head. My son and I would visit her every couple of weeks just to check in and keep tabs on her, and see if she needed anything. She lived with her grandson, who is 23.

She went into surgery, but it didn't appear she would really recover from this. We went to visit her a few times in the hospital. My mother was there every day as she the medical decision making power. She was not going to come back and be herself. She was breathing on her own however she didn't respond to us really. She would look around and turn toward a voice, but otherwise she didn't really respond. She had a dnr and she had told us she didn't want extraordinary measures taken. So the decision was made to let her go. It was sad that she died this way, and so soon. We surely didn't expect it this quickly, and certainly not from a stroke.

The boys got along with the Uncle and the cousins, who are all girls, got along with my daughter.  The only one no one could stand was the aunt (newly married). The visit took a bad turn when the Aunt started treating my daughter more like an 'evil step daughter' than one of her family.  If my daughter left out clothes or food she would call her many ugly names and send her away to her room alone.  It made a weird rift between my daughter and her cousins, Uncle and brother.  No one felt comfortable and my daughter called every day for me to allow her to fly home.  I don't quite understand anything that happened because their last visit last summer was amazing and my daughter didn't even want to come home.

I had been working on producing an EP as my senior project for months, and it all came together on that night when I performed it for my friends. In a lot of ways, it was very stressful. I tend to put things off until the last minute, but I had been better than usual while working on this project, because I knew I wouldn't be able to throw together a whole EP in just a couple days. Still, I was behind schedule, and still working on the production for my vocals the day of the show. I felt frantic as I spent the whole day getting dressed, doing makeup, finishing up songs, coming up with a setlist, and trying to squeeze in a couple hours of actually practicing. By the time people started arriving, I was definitely nervous but excited to see people actually showing up. I had gotten several other friends to join the show and play before me, so I had fun watching their sets and mentally preparing for mine. The show started a lot later than expected, mostly because the first artist (a duo) didn't show up right on time. Once they arrived, we waited for a decent number of people to show up. In addition to starting late, things started to get slightly more chaotic because we ended up bringing the party-alcohol out a bit earlier than expected. Because the plan was to go straight from release show into birthday party, I had drinks available for the party part of the night. But because things were delayed, and I guess people started to get antsy, it was brought out early when people started asking. It kind of worked out better for me, I think. By the time I was getting up to perform my set, I think a lot of people were not sober. It was probably better that way, because I couldn't remember all of my lyrics! It serves me right for not actually practicing and finishing on the day of the show, but I still had a lot of fun and felt very supported by my friends.

I will ask management if there was something in particular that affected their decision, and if so, are there any suggestions on how I can improve. I will also ask if there are any alternative routes for my advancement, since Ray has taken this open position. Who knows, maybe now that Ray is a Supervisor, he's privy to the behind the scenes action that led to this decision. I think I will ask him about it, and see if he knows why he was picked over me.

This was a very emotional moment for me because I fought for my children for three years, and as a father looking to gain custody of his children it was very difficult. My children were being abused by their mother, and no matter how much proof I provided the courts, they still allowed her to have primary custody of the children. I have never used drugs in a my life, yet the children's mother was using regularly (that's why we separated) for three years. In order to get ""just"" three weekends a month with my kids, I was forced into taking drug and alcohol tests, anger management, etc.. During this time their mother would routinely violate the order that allowed me to see the children on the weekends. She would curse at me, threaten me, tell me I was trash, all right in front of the children. There was a small period where I honestly started to believe the things she would say to me, almost as if I had accepted that I was trash, even though I was doing everything right. I guess after a while I just started to break down, I was constantly in debt due to the cost of lawyers, and was just mentally drained. Thankfully I had my family to pick up the the pieces for me, and my children to keep motivating me. In January of 2019, their mothers neighbour called children and youth on her, and abuse was found to be taking place in the home, and in the end custody was removed from her, and given to me. The amount of relief I experienced is not measurable. The day I received the order signed by a judge, I just remember breaking down and crying. I dont think I will ever forget that day. Even though I was able to gain full custody of the children, I still hold sort of an resentment against the legal system. I honestly do believe if I was not a man trying to gain custody of his children, and the roles were reversed, it would have taken less than six months. I mean from the very beginning I had proof of the abuse taking place, and the courts just did not care. My children are safe, and happy today though.

I don't think I was hungover, but I was definitely tired. My room was a mess, as usual, but I managed to find my graduation cap and gown and make my way to my house's dining hall for breakfast. We had really nice croissant egg and ham sandwiches, but also mimosas. These would later prove to be a mistake. After eating and having some existential dread with my roommates, we lined up outside to walk toward Harvard Yard for the Morning Exercises. We were led by a very small band, and I remember it feeling a bit strange how few of the hundred or so people there I really knew, despite having lived with them for the past three years. We made our way to the Memorial Chapel, where somehow (and certainly against fire codes), all roughly 1600 members of Harvard College's Class of 2019 were squeezed in. The minister provided a brief service, focusing largely on how important it was to remember to always think of others. This of course being a Harvard graduation, I knew that many of my classmates would go on to become business and political leaders, which are of course not a group generally thought of as being particularly ethical. After the service, we were herded back out into the Yard to begin the procession, led by my favorite organization, the Harvard University Band. It was at this point that my bladder was greatly beginning to regret the mimosas and coffee I'd had earlier in the morning. I took my seat next to my roommates, and we waited as all the pomp and circumstance commenced, beginning with the Sheriff of Middlesex County, adorned with a fine jacked and top hat, walked onto the stage and banged his silver-tipped staff three times, shouting that he did ""declare that the meeting will be in order!"". Eventually, the dean of each school would tell their students to rise and President Bacow would declare them to be graduated.

However, unlike a normal job, I worked third shift. It was pretty dark out this night, whereas the moonlight would usually light my way. That being said, driving conditions were a bit below optimal. On top of that, I was tired from working most of the night. About half way through the drive home, A large semi truck pulled out in front of me from an intersection not too far ahead. I could tell instantly that he did not see me coming, and I slammed on my breaks. Unfortunately, It was too late. I slid right into him at about 30 miles per hour, right on the front left of my car to the corner of his back bumper. My left shoulder and arm were fractured, but my car was completely destroyed. I was devastated, I had never been in an accident before this. I really had no idea what would happen if I would even be able to get to work the next day. The truck driver got out and told me he works for Coca Cola. He said he had to call his supervisor in to bring insurance information, and to get mine. I called the police and reported the accident while waiting for the supervisor to show up. Once the supervisor was there, we exchanged insurance information, and I asked him if he could give me a ride home. Luckily, he said yes. It wasn't even until the next day that I realized how serious my injuries were. My shoulder and arm received 2 different types of fractions from hitting the dashboard. I woke up with immense pain, feeling unable to go to work that night. I went to an urgent care facility at around 6 pm and they knew right away my left arm and shoulder were either broken or fractured, or both. I set up an appointment with a doctor, and eventually ended up with a cast for 9 months.

Most of us did not even talk to the birthday girl because she was sitting at a different table from most of us. I ended up sitting with people that I knew, so it was as if I just went to go out to eat with these people for no occasion. Nevertheless, the restaurant was so good and I had good conversation. The food was expensive and so was the commute (1 hour), but I still think it was worth it. I got my friend a pusheen plushy and she seemed to really like the gift.

Azul was hatched back in February and I have been hand feeding him since March when he was pulled from his nest box.  Having to feed him every 2 hours was hard and stressful, but after today that stress and hard work finally payed off!  Now that he has been on solid food since May, we've been trying to start his training to fly, but in order to do that, we need him to willingly step out of his enclosure and onto our hands.  We've been letting him learn to fly by letting him out of his enclosure and to just hang out in our prep kitchen while we work on cutting up fruits and vegetables for the the other birds.  Azul has been allowed to do whatever he wanted since about the end of May, but now that it's July, it is time for him to start his formal training.  The first thing I had to teach him was how to step onto my hand for a piece of food.  It was a struggle at first because he always wanted to play with our hand instead of offering a foot.  So when we'd place our hand out he would instead try to bite it to elicit a response from us (usually we'd would scratch his head so he didn't know why my hand was in front of his foot.)   For the first week of July I would place my hand by his perch and say ""Step up"" and if he moved towards my hand or lifted his foot, I would give him a piece.  Then when he got good at that, I would do the same thing, however instead for him to move towards my hand to reward him, I waited until he was fully placing a foot on my hand before he got his treat.  This past week I have been working daily with him and he has been progressing little by little.  Just on Monday he though about lifting the other foot off the perch.  Unfortunately I had to skip his training these past few days due to how busy we have been so Azul hasn't gotten any practice for the past three days.  I was expecting when I got into work today and got ready to train him that Azul would be back as square one after having those few days off.  However, instead of regressing in his training he actually progressed with out me!  When I asked him to ""Step up"" he did the cutest little hop and landed, both feet on my hand.  I was so excited that I had to remember not to jump or I might scare Azul.  It was such a moment to be held. After months of us hand-raising him and Azul getting some independence from us for a month I didn't realize how exciting and emotion filled getting over the first hurtle of training would be for me.  To hatch this gut go from being an egg to a bird who came on cue was such a joyous moment that I realized what this job was going to be like.  Leading up to this point, everyday was stressful and felt overbearing.
